**** ABSTRACT
     This paper presents an agent-based model of worker protest. Workers have
     varying degrees of grievance depending on the difference between their wage
     and the average of their neighbors. They protest with probabilities
     proportional to grievance, but are inhibited by the risk of being
     arrested—which is determined by the ratio of coercive agents to probable
     rebels in the local area. We explore the effect of similarity perception on
     the dynamics of collective behavior. If workers are surrounded by more
     in-group members, they are more risk-taking; if surrounded by more out-group
     members, more risk-averse. Individual interest and group membership jointly
     affect patterns of workers protest: rhythm, frequency, strength, and duration
     of protest outbreaks. Results indicate that when wages are more unequally
     distributed, the previous outburst tends to suppress the next one, protests
     occur more frequently, and they become more intensive and persistent. Group
     identification does not seriously influence the frequency of local uprisings.
     Both their strength and duration, however, are negatively affected by the
     ingroup-outgroup assessment. The overall findings are valid when workers
     distinguish 'us' from 'them' through simple binary categorization, as well as
     when they perceive degrees of similarity and difference from their neighbors.

*** A Context- and Scope-Sensitive Analysis of Narrative Data to Aid the Specification of Agent Behaviour

**** ABSTRACT
     A structure for analysing narrative data is suggested, one that distinguishes
     three parts in sequence: context (a heuristic to identify what knowledge is
     relevant given a kind of situation), scope (what is possible within that
     situation) and narrative elements (the detailed conditional and sequential
     structure of actions and events given the context and scope). This structure is
     first motivated and then illustrated with some simple examples taken from
     Sukaina Bharwani's thesis (Bharwani 2004). It is suggested that such a structure
     might be helpful in preserving more of the natural meaning of such data, as well
     as being a good match to a context-dependent computational architecture, and
     thus facilitate the process of using narrative data to inform the specification
     of behavioural rules in an Agent-Based Simulation. This suggestion only solves
     part of the 'Narrative Data to Agent Behaviour' puzzle — this structure needs to
     be combined and improved by other methods and appropriate computational
     architectures designed to suit it.

**** ABSTRACT
     Delegation is a foundational concept for understanding and engineering systems
     that interact and execute tasks autonomously. By extending recent work on tensed
     action logic, it becomes possible to pin down a specific interpretation of
     responsibility with a well specified semantics and a convenient and intuitive
     logic for expression. Once descriptions of direct agent responsibility can be
     formed, there is a foundation upon which to characterise the dynamics of how
     responsibility can be acquired, transferred and discharged and, in particular,
     how delegation can be effected. The resulting logic, designed specifically to
     cater for responsibility and delegation, can then be employed to offer an
     axiological and semantic exploration of the related concepts of forbearance,
     imperatives and group communication.

**** ABSTRACT
     Logical architectures combine several logics in to a more complex logcal
     system. In this paper we study a logical architecture using input/output
     operations corresponding to the functionality of logical components. We
     illustrate how the architectural approach can be used to develop a logic of a
     normative system based on logics of counts-as conditionals, institutional
     constraints, obligations and permissions. In this example we adapt for
     counts-as conditionals and institutional constraints a proposal of Jones and
     Sergot, and for obligations and permissions we adapt the input/output logic
     framework of Makinson and van der Torre. We use our architecture to study
     logical relations among counts-as conditionals, institutional constraints,
     obligations and permissions. We show that in our logical architecture the
     combined system of counts-as conditionals and institutional constraints
     reduces to the logic of institutional constraints, which again reduces to an
     expression in the underlying base logic. Counts-as conditionals and
     institutional constraints are defined as a pre-processing step for the
     regulative norms. Permissions are defined as exceptions to obligations and
     their interaction is characterized.

**** ABSTRACT
     Videogames require robust yet flexible methods and vocabularies of critical
     analysis that appreciate both the textual and embodied pleasures of
     players. Such analysis cannot start with the player’s intentions as an
     autonomous user nor with the videogame as a stable object; rather, it must
     account for the dynamic interplay between videogame hardware, sensorial
     perception, and audiovisual and haptic representations. If it is to
     understand how a particular videogame is engaged as both textual artefact
     and embodied practice, such analysis must be concerned with not just what
     the player does with the videogame, but what the videogame does with the
     player. This thesis forwards a phenomenology of videogame experience to
     account for how
     the player and the videogame incorporate each other in reflexive cycles that
     mediate presence, attention, perception, and agency. It does not hope to
     understand videogames either ‘as narratives’ or ‘as games’ but as particular
     amalgamations of existing and nascent media and forms—it hopes to understand
     videogames as videogames. It explores videogame play as a convergence of
     eyes-on-screens, ears-at-speakers, and muscles-against-interfaces to interrogate
     the limits of current game studies approaches that often obscure rich
     commonalities between videogames and other media forms. Drawing upon
     phenomenology, posthumanism, and cyborg theory, and embedded in detailed and
     multifaceted analyses of various videogames on different platforms as played,
     this thesis develops nuanced understandings of how the player and the videogame
     come together during play to form particular modes of embodiment through which a
     videogame work is both interpreted and perceived.

**** ABSTRACT
     The issues of empirical calibration of parameter values and functional
     relationships describing the interactions between the various actors plays an
     important role in agent based modelling. Agent-based models range from purely
     theoretical exercises focussing on the patterns in the dynamics of
     interactions processes to modelling frameworks which are oriented closely at
     the replication of empirical cases. ABMs are classified in terms of their
     generality and their use of empirical data. In the literature the
     recommendation can be found to aim at maximizing both criteria by building
     so-called 'abductive models'. This is almost the direct opposite of Milton
     Friedman's famous and provocative methodological credo 'the more significant
     a theory, the more unrealistic the assumptions'. Most methodologists and
     philosophers of science have harshly criticised Friedman's essay as
     inconsistent, wrong and misleading. By presenting arguments for a pragmatic
     reinterpretation of Friedman's essay, we will show why most of the
     philosophical critique misses the point. We claim that good simulations have
     to rely on assumptions, which are adequate for the purpose in hand and those
     are not necessarily the descriptively accurate ones.

     information are taken into consideration. In addition, the effect of local
     interactions at different scales over time and space is visualized through the
     VCL interface. Information repositories, cultural items, borders, population
     size, individual' tendencies and other features are determined by the user.
     Finally, the researcher can also isolate specific factors whose effect on the
     global system might be of interest to the researcher. All the code can be found

**** ABSTRACT
     This short note makes recommendations for the future direction of research in
     agent-based modelling (ABM). It is a personal view based on my experience as a
     policy adviser who has recently come to ABM. I suggest that to promote the use
     of ABM, the ABM community needs demonstrate the value of modelling to other
     social scientists by showing-by-doing and offering training projects; and to
     produce tools, guidance on good-practice and basic building blocks. Then the
     policy contexts most likely to benefit from ABM need to be identified along with
     any new data requirements, so that the usefulness of ABM can be demonstrated to
     policy analysts. This is, in my view, the challenge facing the ABM community for
     the next 15 years.

**** ABSTRACT
     Cohen, March and Olsen's Garbage Can Model (GCM) of organizational choice
     represent perhaps the first — and remains by far the most influential —
     agent-based representation of organizational decision processes. According
     to the GCM organizations are conceptualized as crossroads of time-dependent
     flows of four distinct classes of objects: 'participants,' 'opportunities,'
     'solutions' and 'problems.' Collisions among the different objects generate
     events called 'decisions.' In this paper we use NetLogo to build an explicit
     agent-based representation of the original GCM. We conduct a series of
     simulation experiments to validate and extend some of the most interesting
     conclusions of the GCM. We show that our representation is able to reproduce
     a number of properties of the original model. Yet, unlike the original
     model, in our representation these properties are not encoded explicitly,
     but emerge from general principles of the Garbage Can decision processes.

**** ABSTRACT
     In this paper we try to replicate the simulation results reported by Axelrod
     (1986) in an influential paper on the evolution of social norms. Our study
     shows that Axelrod's results are not as reliable as one would desire. We can
     obtain the opposite results by running the model for longer, by slightly
     modifying some of the parameters, or by changing some arbitrary assumptions
     in the model. This re-implementation exercise illustrates the importance of
     running stochastic simulations several times for many periods, exploring the
     parameter space adequately, complementing simulation with analytical work,
     and being aware of the scope of our simulation models.

**** ABSTRACT
     This article has two primary objectives: (i) to replicate an agent-based model
     of social interaction by Bhavnani (2003), in which the author explicitly
     specifies mechanisms underpinning Robert Putnam's (1993) work on Civic
     Traditions in Modern Italy, bridging the gap between the study's historical
     starting point—political regimes that characterized 14th Century Italy—and
     contemporary levels of social capitalóreflected in a 'civic' North and an
     'un-civic' South; and (ii) to extend the original analysis, using a landscape of
     Italy that accounts for population density. The replication exercise is
     performed by different authors using an entirely distinct ABM toolkit (PS-I)
     with its own rule set governing agent-interaction and cultural change. The
     extension, which more closely approximates a docking exercise, utilizes equal
     area cartograms otherwise known as density-equalizing maps (Gastner and
     Newman 2004) to resize the territory according to 1993 population estimates. Our
     results indicate that: (i) using the criterion of distributional equivalence, we
     experience mixed success in replicating the original model given our inability
     to restrict the selection of partners to 'eligible' neighbors and limit the
     number of agent interactions in a timestep; (ii) increasing the number of agents
     and introducing more realistic population distributions in our extension of the
     replication model increases distributional equivalence; (iii) using the weaker
     criteria of relational alignment, both the replication model and its extension
     capture the basic relationship between institutional effectiveness and civic
     change, the effect of open boundaries, historical shocks, and path dependence;
     and (iv) that replication and docking may be usefully combined in model-to-model
     analysis, with an eye towards verification, reimplementation, and alignment.

**** ABSTRACT
     As they involve relationships between interacting individuals and groups,
     social systems can be described at different levels of resolution. In a
     number of modeling cases, only one of these levels is explicitly represented.
     In order to study phenomena where both individual and collective
     representations are needed, multi-level modeling is a good approach as it
     explicitly represents these different levels. We propose to consider a
     multi-level representation from a multi-modeling point of view. This
     perspective allows explicitly specifying the level's relationships and,
     therefore, to test hypothesis about interaction between individuals and
     groups in social systems. We define a framework to better specify the
     concepts used in multi-level modeling and their relationships. This framework
     is implemented through the AA4MM meta-model, which benefits from a middleware
     layer. This meta-model uses the multi-agent paradigm to consider a
     multi-model as a society of interacting models. We extend this meta-model to
     consider multi-level modeling, and present a proof of concept of a collective
     motion example, where we show the advantages of this approach for the study
     of social phenomena.

**** ABSTRACT
     Industrial districts can be conceived as complex systems characterised by a
     network of interactions amongst heterogeneous, localised, functionally
     integrated and complementary firms. In a previous paper, we have introduced an
     industrial district computational prototype, showing that the economic
     performance of an industrial district proceeds to the form through which firms
     interact and co-ordinate each others. In this paper, we use such computational
     framework to experiment different options of 'local institutional engineering',
     trying to understand how specific 'supporting institutions' could perform
     macro-collective activities, such as, i.e., technology research, transfer and
     information, improving the technological adaptation of firms. Is a district more
     than a simple aggregation of localised firms? What can explain the economic
     performance of firms localised into the same space? Could some options of 'local
     institutional engineering' improve the performance of a district? Could such
     options set aside the problem of how firms dynamically interact? These are
     questions explored in this paper.

**** ABSTRACT
     How do individuals resolve conflicts over resources? One way is to share
     resources, which is possible between known individuals, with the use of
     sanctions on free riders or by partner selection. Another way is for anonymous
     individuals to respect the finders' ownership of resources based on asymmetry
     and avoid conflicts over resources. This study elucidates the conditions under
     which anonymous individuals share resources with each other irrespective of
     their asymmetry with regard to resources. High resource values inhibit anonymous
     individuals from sharing resources; however, small cumulative values and local
     distributions let anonymous individuals share the resources. Punishment of the
     richest individuals also supports resource sharing. These conditions may
     represent resource sharing among anonymous individuals in periods of great
     disasters and may be the origin of the practice of exchange in prehistoric
     times.

**** ABSTRACT
     Several strategies are used to explain emergent interaction patterns in
     agent-based simulations. A distinction can be made between simulations in which
     the agents just behave in a reactive way, and simulations involving agents with
     also pro-active (goal-directed) behavior. Pro-active behavior is more variable
     and harder to predict than reactive behavior, and therefore it might be harder
     to explain. However, the approach presented in this paper tries to make
     advantage of the agents' pro-activeness by using it to explain their behavior.
     The aggregation of the agents' explanations form a basis for explaining the
     simulation as a whole. In this paper, an agent model that is able to generate
     (pro-active) behavior and explanations about that behavior is introduced, and
     the implementation of the model is discussed. Examples show how the link between
     behavior generation and explanation in the model can contribute to the
     explanation of a simulation.

**** ABSTRACT
     Using OWL ontologies to represent the state and structure of a simulation at any
     one time has been argued to improve the transparency of a social simulation, on
     the basis that this information is then not embedded in the source code of the
     model, or in the computer's memory at run-time. Should transparency of such a
     form be desirable, it would be preferable to enable it by extracting the
     information automatically from a running model. However, semantic differences
     between traditional object-oriented programming languages and description logics
     pose an obstacle to this. This paper presents arguments that Netlogo does not
     have the same semantic challenges to automated ontology extraction, and
     describes an extension to Netlogo (5.0) using the OWL-API (3.1.0) that extracts
     state and structure ontologies from an existing Netlogo model. The extension is
     freely available from
     https://github.com/garypolhill/netlogo-owl.

**** ABSTRACT
     This paper discusses some of the merits of the use of formal logic in
     multi-agent systems and agent-based simulation research. Reasons for the
     plethora of formal systems are discussed as well as how formal systems and
     agent-based social simulation can work together. As an example a formal system
     for describing social relationships and interactions in a multi-agent system is
     presented and how this could benefit from agent-based social simulation as well
     as make a contribution is discussed.

**** ABSTRACT
     This paper is intended to analyse the concepts involved in the phenomena of
     social monitoring and norm-based social influence for systems of normative
     agents. These are here defined as deliberative agents, representing norms and
     deciding upon them. Normative agents can use the norms to evaluate others'
     behaviours and, possibly, convince them to comply with norms. Normative
     agents contribute to the social dynamics of norms, and more specifically, of
     norm-based social control and influence. In fact, normative intelligence
     allows agents to

     Check the efficacy of the norms (the extent to which a norm is applied in the
     system in which it is in force), and possibly Urge their fellows to obey the
     norms.

     The following issues are addressed:

     What is norm-based control?
     Why and how do agents exercise control on one another?
     What role does it play in the spread of norms?

**** ABSTRACT
     Changing consumer behaviour is key to reducing the environmental effects of
     industrialised societies. Social practice theories provide an integrated
     approach to understanding consumer behaviour. The mechanisms underlying the
     emergence and diffusion of social practices are however until now poorly
     understood. This paper presents a conceptual framework and an abstract
     agent-based simulation model for generating social practices which use and
     extend approaches from social practice theories. The main results are
     twofold. First, the simulation model is able to generate social practices,
     what confirms that the conceptual framework captures relevant elements and
     processes. Second, a new mechanism for behavioural lock-in is identified
     that provides additional insights into the widely acknowledged challenge of
     changing social practices and respective consumption.

**** ABSTRACT
     This paper models the early dynamics of insurgency using an agent-based computer
     simulation of civilians, insurgents, and soldiers. In the simulation, insurgents
     choose to attack government forces, which then strike back. Such government
     counterattacks may result in the capture or killing of insurgents, may make
     nearby civilians afraid to become insurgents, but may also increase the anger of
     surrounding civilians if there is significant collateral damage. If civilians
     become angry enough, they become new insurgents. I simulate the dynamics of
     these interactions, focusing on the effectiveness of government forces at
     capturing insurgents vs. their accuracy in avoiding collateral damage. The
     simulations suggest that accuracy (avoidance of collateral damage) is more
     important for the long-term defeat of insurgency than is effectiveness at
     capturing insurgents in any given counterattack. There also may be a critical
     'tipping point' for accuracy below which the length of insurgencies increases
     dramatically. The dynamics of how insurgencies grow or decline in response to
     various combinations of government accuracy and effectiveness illustrate the
     tradeoffs faced by governments in dealing with the early stages of an
     insurgency.

**** ABSTRACT
     This paper investigates the contribution of evidence-based modelling to
     grounded theory (GT). It is argued that evidence-based modelling provides
     additional sources to truly arrive at a theory through the inductive process
     of a Grounded Theory approach. This is shown by two examples. One example
     concerns the development of software ontologies of criminal organisations.
     The other example is a simulation model of escalation of ethno-nationalist
     conflicts. The first example concerns early to middle stages of the research
     process. The development of an ontology provides a tool for the process of
     theoretical coding in a GT approach. The second example shows stylised facts
     resulting from a simulation model of the escalation of ethno-nationalist
     conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. These reveal mechanisms of nationalist
     radicalisation. This provides additional credibility for the claim that
     evidence-based modelling assists to inductively generate a theory in a GT
     approach.

     theoretic concept of action in the tradition of Durkheim and Parsons. This
     paper investigates to what extend normative agent-based models are able to
     capture the role theoretic concept of norms. Three methodological core
     problems are identified: the question of norm transmission, normative
     transformation of agents and what kind of analysis the models contribute.
     It can be shown that initially the models appeared only to address some of
     these problems rather than all of them simultaneously. More recent
     developments, however, show progress in that direction. However, the degree
     of resolution of intra agent processes remains too low for a comprehensive
     understanding of normative behaviour regulation.

**** ABSTRACT
     Small-world and power-law network structures have been prominently proposed as
     models of large networks. However, the assumptions of these models usually lack
     sociological grounding. We present a computational model grounded in social
     exchange theory. Agents search attractive exchange partners in a diverse
     population. Agent use simple decision heuristics, based on imperfect, local
     information. Computer simulations show that the topological structure of the
     emergent social network depends heavily upon two sets of conditions, harshness
     of the exchange game and learning capacities of the agents. Further analysis
     show that a combination of these conditions affects whether star-like,
     small-world or power-law structures emerge.

**** ABSTRACT
     When designing an agent-based simulation, an important question to answer is
     how to model the decision making processes of the agents in the system. A
     large number of agent decision making models can be found in the literature,
     each inspired by different aims and research questions. In this paper we
     provide a review of 14 agent decision making architectures that have
     attracted interest. They range from production-rule systems to
     psychologically- and neurologically-inspired approaches. For each of the
     architectures we give an overview of its design, highlight research questions
     that have been answered with its help and outline the reasons for the choice
     of the decision making model provided by the originators. Our goal is to
     provide guidelines about what kind of agent decision making model, with which
     level of simplicity or complexity, to use for which kind of research
     question.

     In AI research, the task frequently falls
     upon the Ph.D. student of taking a rough theory and "making it work". Rarely
     does this theory ''work'' right away. New theories have to be postulated and
     refinements made to old theories before anything can work at all.
     In addition, successful Ph.D. theses have the pleasant effect of pointing
     towards where we are going next. In the cases presented in this volume, where
     towards where we are going next.

**** ABSTRACT
     This paper presents a study into the benefits imparted by friendly civilian
     populaces in assisting peacekeepers to conduct operations under the threat of
     guerrilla warfare. In this study, civilians report observed insurgent activity
     to peacekeepers with varying levels of enthusiasm depending on the reputation of
     the peacekeepers with the local populace. A simulation model is developed using
     an agent-based approach and a statistically significant number of Monte Carlo
     simulations conducted to measure the success of the peacekeeping operations and
     the benefits of civilian assistance.

**** ABSTRACT
     Multi-agent simulation was used to study several styles of leadership in small
     societies. Populations of 50 and100 agents inhabited a bounded landscape
     containing a fixed number of food sources. Agents moved about the landscape in
     search of food, mated, produced offspring, and died either of hunger or at a
     predetermined maximum age. Leadership models focused on the collection and
     redistribution of food. The simulations suggest that individual households were
     more effective at meeting their needs than a simple collection-redistribution
     scheme. Leadership affected the normative makeup of the population: altruistic
     leaders caused altruistic societies and demanding leaders caused aggressive
     societies. Specific leadership styles did not provide a clear advantage when two
     groups competed for the same resources. The simulation results are compared to
     ethnographic observations of leadership in Pacific island societies.

**** ABSTRACT
     The process of learning in social-ecological systems is an emerging area of
     research, but little attention has been given to how social and ecological
     interactions motivate or inhibit learning. This is highly relevant to the
     South African water sector, where a major policy transition is occurring that
     provides local water users and managers with new opportunities to engage in
     adaptive learning about how to balance human and ecological needs for water.
     In this paper, an agent-based model is used to explore potential 'learning
     dilemmas', or barriers to learning in the South African water sector, whereby
     human perceptions combined with social-ecological conditions affect the
     capacity, understanding, and willingness required to learn. Agents manage
     water according to different management strategies and use various indicators
     to evaluate their success. The model shows that in areas with highly variable
     hydrological regimes, agents may be less able to learn because conditions are
     too unpredictable for them to benefit from past experience. Because of these
     changing conditions, however, agents are more likely to try new water
     management strategies, promoting a greater diversity of experience in the
     system for agents to learn from in the future. In water-stressed areas, where
     agents tend to have greater difficulty fulfilling demand for water than in
     areas with abundant water supplies, they are also more apt to try new
     strategies. When learning is restricted to small areas, agents may learn more
     quickly but based on a more narrow range of experience than in larger or more
     heterogeneous areas. These results suggest a need to enhance learning so that
     it accounts for interacting hydrological, ecological, and social dynamics.
     Although the model is a highly stylised version of reality, this preliminary
     exploration may eventually help to reverse the past trend of poor
     understanding of social-ecological dynamics as they relate to water
     management.

**** ABSTRACT
     In this paper we introduce and motivate a conceptualization framework for
     agent-based social simulation, MAIA: Modelling Agent systems based on
     Institutional Analysis. The MAIA framework is based on Ostrom's Institutional
     Analysis and Development framework, and provides an extensive set of modelling
     concepts that is rich enough to capture a large range of complex social
     phenomena. Developing advanced agent-based models requires substantial
     experience and knowledge of software development knowledge and skills. MAIA has
     been developed to help modellers who are unfamiliar with software development to
     conceptualize and implement agent-based models. It provides the foundation for a
     conceptualization procedure that guides modellers to adequately capture,
     analyse, and understand the domain of application, and helps them report
     explicitly on the motivations behind modelling choices. A web-based application
     supports conceptualization with MAIA, and outputs an XML file which is used to
     generate Java code for an executable simulation.

     multi-agent based social simulation building on recent progress in the area of
     agent-oriented programming languages. The platform is called MAS-SOC, and the
     approach to building multi-agent based simulations with it includes the use of
     Jason, an interpreter for an extended version of AgentSpeak, and ELMS, a
     language for modelling environments where cognitive agents are situated. This
     article also mentions recent work on the use of ontologies in defining
     environments with ELMS and illustrates the approach with a simple example.

**** ABSTRACT
     There is growing interest in extending complex systems approaches to the social
     sciences. This is apparent in the increasingly widespread literature and
     journals that deal with the topic and is being facilitated by adoption of
     multi-agent simulation in research. Much of this research uses simple agents to
     explore limited aspects of social behaviour. Incorporation of higher order
     capabilities such as cognition into agents has proven problematic. Influenced by
     AI approaches, where cognitive capability has been sought, it has commonly been
     attempted based on a 'representational' theory of cognition. This has proven
     computationally expensive and difficult to implement. There would be some
     benefit also in the development of a framework for social simulation research
     which provides a consistent set of assumptions applicable in different fields
     and which can be scaled to apply to simple and more complex simulation tasks.
     This paper sets out, as a basis for discussion, a meta-model incorporating an
     'enactive' model of cognition drawing on both complex system insights and the
     theory of autopoiesis. It is intended to provide an ontology that avoids some of
     the limitation of more traditional approaches and at the same time providing a
     basis for simulation in a wide range of fields and pursuant of a wider range of
     human behaviours.

**** ABSTRACT
     In this paper we study the emergence and the effects of a possession norm in
     an artificial society. We link the study of norms and the concept of memes
     as put forward by Richard Dawkins. Normative behaviour is modelled using
     memes as carriers for certain behaviours. For our simulations we extend the
     sugarscape model from Epstein and Axtell (1996) and give the agents the
     possibility to claim possession of a "plot" of land. Memes regulate the
     behaviour of the agents regarding the land claims of others. It turns out
     that the probability for the survival of the population is much higher when
     possession claims of others are respected. However, there exist short term
     disadvantages for agents respecting the possessions of others. Thus, the
     need for a possession norm arises. The introduction of sanctions provides a
     good possibility to enforce the norm as long as no costs arise for
     sanctioning agents. We also investigate different kinds of meme propagation
     and their effects on the establishment of the norm.

**** ABSTRACT
     In this tongue-in-cheek commentary the author takes a serious look at the
     problem of translating ethnographic conclusions into simple functions as a means
     to the end of building an agent-based simulation in the Netlogo language.
     Specifically, the goal is to take the simple fact that stories about illicit
     drugs have a lot to do with whether or not they will be used and see if an
     agent-based model can produce an epidemic incidence curve under the appropriate
     conditions. This commentary has less to do with the model and more to do with
     figuring out what kinds of numbers make sense. Based on the principle that
     mathematical ignorance is bliss, the author concludes that the most important
     thing is that number construction reflects the differences that make a
     difference in the ethnographic work, where the discovery of what the significant
     differences in fact were was a major result of the research. Support by NIH/NIDA

**** ABSTRACT
     This paper addresses Narrative Intelligence from a bottom up, Artificial Life
     perspective. First, different levels of narrative intelligence are discussed in
     the context of human and robotic story-tellers. Then, we introduce a
     computational framework which is based on minimal definitions of stories,
     story-telling and autobiographic agents. An experimental test-bed is described
     which is applied to the study of story-telling, using robotic agents as examples
     of situated, autonomous minimal agents. Experimental data are provided which
     support the working hypothesis that story-telling can be advantageous, i.e.
     increases the survival of an autonomous, autobiographic, minimal agent. We
     conclude this paper by discussing implications of this approach for
     story-telling in humans and artifacts.

**** ABSTRACT
     In this article, principles of architectures relating to normative agents are
     evaluated with regard to the question whether and to what extend results of
     empirical research are incorporated in the architecture. In the human sciences,
     internalisation is a crucial element within the concept of norms.
     Internalisation distinguishes normative behaviour regulation from mere coercion.
     The aim of this article is to begin answering the question of to what extent
     normative agent architectures represent the theoretical construct of norm
     internalisation. The relevant research in this area may be found in
     socialisation research in psychology and sociology. Evaluation of conclusions
     from the empirical sciences allows to identify drawbacks and opportunities in
     existing architectures, as well as to develop suggestions for future
     development.

**** ABSTRACT
     In this paper, the role of normative reputation in reducing the costs of
     complying with norms will be explored. In previous simulations (Conte &
     Castelfranchi 1995), in contrast to a traditional view of norms as means for
     increasing co-ordination among agents, the effects of normative and
     non-normative strategies in the control of aggression among agents in a common
     environment was confronted. Normative strategies were found to reduce aggression
     to a much greater extent than non-normative strategies, and also to afford the
     highest average strength and the lowest polarisation of strength among the
     agents. The present study explores the effects of the interaction between
     populations following different criteria for aggression control. In such a
     situation the normative agents alone bear the cost of norms, due to their less
     aggressive behaviour, while other agents benefit from their presence. Equity is
     then restored by raising the cost of aggression through the introduction of
     agents' reputation. This allows normative agents to avoid respecting the
     cheaters' private property, and to impose a price for transgression. The
     relevance of knowledge communication is then emphasised by allowing neighbour
     normative agents to communicate. In particular, the spreading of agents'
     reputation via communication allows normative agents to co-operate without
     deliberation at the expense of non-normative agents, thereby redistributing the
     costs of normative strategies.

**** ABSTRACT
     Most works on norms have investigated how norms are regulated using
     institutional mechanisms. Very few works have focused on how an agent may infer
     the norms of a society without the norm being explicitly given to the agent.
     This paper describes a mechanism for identifying one type of norm, an obligation
     norm. The Obligation Norm Inference (ONI) algorithm described in this paper
     makes use of an association rule mining approach to identify obligation norms.
     Using agent based simulation of a virtual restaurant we demonstrate how an agent
     can identify the tipping norm. The experiments that we have conducted
     demonstrate that an agent in the system is able to add, remove and modify norms
     dynamically. An agent can also flexibly modify the parameters of the system
     based on whether it is successful in identifying a norm.

**** ABSTRACT
     In this article we look at how a social interaction model can be developed that
     takes into account the influence that perceived attitudes can have on the
     resulting dynamics. The model is based on a pair interaction situation and a
     master equation approach. The model can be easily programmed using standard high
     level simulation languages. Some simulation studies are presented in the
     article.

**** ABSTRACT
     We describe CLIPS-R, a theory revision system for the revision of CLIPS
     rule-bases. CLIPS-R differs from previous theory revision systems in that it
     operates on forward chaining production systems. Revision of production system
     rule-bases is important because production systems can perform a variety of
     tasks such as monitoring and design in addition to classification tasks that
     have been addressed by previous research. We show that CLIPS-R can take
     advantage of a variety of user specified constraints on the correct
     processing of instances, such as ordering constraints on the displaying of
     information, and the contents of the final fact list. In addition, we show that
     CLIPS-R can operate as well as existing systems when the only constraint on
     processing an instance is the correct classification of the instance.

**** ABSTRACT
     Weber’s ideal typical model of bureaucracy constitutes the starting point for
     most scholarship on organizations. Much organizational behaviour, however
     occurs outside this formalized model. It is thus somewhat surprising that
     behaviours outside the formal-rational model are, more often than not,
     treated as aberrations. In contrast, the emerging critical literature on
     ‘inhabited institutions’ has identified such gaps in our theoretical
     understanding as foundational, warranting a more agentic conception of
     organizational life—a conception more fully acknowledging of and sensitive to
     the dynamics of power in organizational life. In this regard, we highlight
     four prevalent (though seldom theoretically incorporated) features of
     contemporary bureaucracies—divergent goals, patrimonialism, unwritten rules
     and chaos. These features, which we contend are no less critical to
     organizational functioning than those identified by Weber, constitute an
     organizational logic more compatible with a Kafkan vision of bureaucracy than
     with a Weberian one. Theorizing such attributes allows us to explore elements
     of bureaucratic life that the formal-rational model of bureaucracy renders
     largely invisible and is conceptually and empirically ill equipped to
     incorporate. An illustrative analysis, drawing on narrative data drawn from
     the population of organizational ethnographies (n = 162) (1) demonstrates the
     prominence of such dynamics in organizational life; and (2) highlights their
     implications for rule breaking as a relatively common yet under-theorized
     occurrence. A core implication of our analysis and critique is that the
     social sciences need a fundamentally revised theory of bureaucracy capable of
     understanding bureaucracy’s power laden and often dystrophic features.

**** ABSTRACT
     Inmate group behavior is a complex phenomenon that many researchers have
     attempted to understand. Most of the individual theories applied to this issue
     have had limited success. This work uses computer simulation to apply a complex
     theory of organizational control to the issue of inmate group behavior that
     incorporates all the major theoretical components found in the individual
     theories. The complete theory is first presented and then basic simulation
     results are discussed. The findings show that the simulated theory produced
     results that are empirically realistic. The control processes used by prisons
     generally produce compliance from inmates but these same control processes
     result in episodic periods of negative inmate group behavior. These initial
     results point to the promise of computer simulation for understanding complex
     control issues in ways simpler theories cannot.

**** ABSTRACT
     In this paper, we compare the computational and sociological study of norms, and
     resimulate previous simulations (Conte and Castelfranchi 1995a, Castelfranchi,
     Conte and Paolucci 1998) under slightly different conditions. First, we analyze
     the relation between norms, social inequality and functional change more
     closely. Due to our results, the hypothesis stating that the "finder-keeper"
     norm while controlling aggression efficaciously reduces social inequality holds
     only in quite egalitarian societies. Throughout a variety of inegalitarian
     societies, it instead increases social inequality. This argument which can be
     traced back to Marx is being investigated by use of computer simulations of
     artificial societies. Second, we remodel normative behaviour from a sociological
     point of view by implementing Haferkamp's theory of action approach to deviant
     behaviour. Following the game theoretic models, the computational study of norms
     has up to now ignored the importance of power in explaining how norms affect
     social behaviour, how norms emerge, become established and internalized, and
     change. By simulating Haferkamp and repeating the Conte and Castelfranchi
     experiments, we demonstrate that it is possible to integrate power into
     computational models of norms.

**** ABSTRACT
     In this paper, we use multiagent technology for social simulation of
     sociological micro-macro issues in the domain of electronic marketplaces. We
     argue that allowing self-interested agents to enable social reputation as a
     mechanism for flexible self-regulation during runtime can improve the
     robustness and 'social order' of multiagent systems to cope with various
     perturbations that arise when simulating open markets (e.g. dynamic
     modifications of task profiles, scaling of agent populations, agent drop-outs,
     deviant behaviour). Referring to the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu, we
     provide a multi-level concept of reputation that consists of three different
     types (image, social esteem, and prestige) and considers reputation as a kind
     of 'symbolic capital'. Reputation is regarded to be objectified as an
     observable property and to be incorporated into the agents' mental structures
     through social practices of communication on different aggregation levels of
     sociality. We present and analyse selected results of our social simulations
     and discuss the importance of reputation with regard to the robustness of
     multiagent simulations of electronic markets.

**** ABSTRACT
     Cultures can be viewed as sets of beliefs and techniques allowing societies to
     cope with their environment. We here propose simple and explicit schemes showing
     how fishermen could encode beliefs about a renewable resource, fish. We then
     discuss the dynamics of the society, represented by economic and cultural
     variables, coupled to the fishery represented by fish abundance. According to
     different coding schemes and sets of parameters, several dynamical regimes are
     observed, including one with endogenous crises.

**** ABSTRACT
     Using ethnography to build agent-based models may result in more empirically
     grounded simulations. Our study on innovation practice and culture in the
     Westland horticulture sector served to explore what information and data
     from ethnographic analysis could be used in models and how. MAIA, a
     framework for agent-based model development of social systems, is our
     starting point for structuring and translating said knowledge into a model.
     The data that was collected through an ethnographic process served as input
     to the agent-based model. We also used the theoretical analysis performed on
     the data to define outcome variables for the simulation. We conclude by
     proposing an initial methodology that describes the use of ethnography in
     modelling.

**** ABSTRACT
     The aim of this paper is to provide an analysis of institutional actions from
     the standpoint of cognitive science.

     The notion of constitutive rules have been proposed to describe the
     conceptual nature of institutions.

     In this paper it is extended to cover specific processes of ‘recognition’ that
     provide the agents with additional artificial powers.

     The power of doing an
     institutional action is considered as a special kind of artificial power.

     It is argued that institutional actions achieve their effects thanks to a
     cognitive and behavioral mediation of a collective of agents.

     Individual actions are seen and treated as (count as) institutional actions
     by the involved participants even if, in fact, institutional actions are
     collective
     actions.

     When human behavior becomes institutionalized, it acquires special
     conventional powers to bring about effects in the social world.

     A model of such conventional empowerment of an agent is proposed and is
     identified in a sort of collective permission.

     Finally it is argued that institutions are a specific kind of coordination
     artifacts.

     In particular, the importance of institutional roles as artifacts that assign
     conventional powers is investigated.

**** Quotes
***** Institution Definitions and claims
      "Institutions are usually conceived as normative systems that structure
      social interactions."

      "As it is generally acknowledged, an institution is a solution to
      coordination problems of a collective, but what seems to be special in the
      case of institutions is that such coordination is obtained thanks to the
      constitution of a new level of actions that can be done. "

      "Our claim is that to institutionalize something is to assign a specific
      kind of artificial powers to it by means of a conceptualization that can be
      expressed by counts as formulas."

      "Our ontological statement is that institutional actions, like paying,
      marrying, promising, having precedence and so on and so forth, are concrete
      physical actions in the physical world. "

      "Our claim is that every individual action in the institution is actually a
      multiagent action where the collectivity unintentionally collaborate so that
      the individual agent achieves his intended results. Differently from the
      previous case, this collaborative action is not intentional. While during
      the ceremony each agent acting in the institutional role cooperates
      intentionally with the other, they are also unintentionally cooperating in
      a very different way."

      "As it is clear the notion of ‘group’ in institutional actions is local,
      context dependent and dynamic."

      "It is a platitude to argue that institutions seem to be something external
      to the agents that enact them while actually they are man made products
      evolved or designed to coordinate agents’ activities."

      "The main difference between conventions and institutions lies in the fact
      that while a convention enables a single-agent action that contributes to a
      multiagent coordination (when acting according to a convention, the agent
      has the power of acting in coordination with others), an institution provides
      individual agents with the special conventional power of doing an action
      which is a multi-agent coordinated action."

      "We have also acknowledged that to get the institutional machinery off the
      ground it is necessary that the involved participants believe that there is
      one agent in the group that has the power of doing the institutional action
      (subjective power)."

***** Mentions of Others
      "We agree with Searle that there is a 'primacy of the micro-level' where the
      individual agents constitute the institution by considering something as
      something else.'

      "Makinson (1986) has argued that ‘having the power is not the same as being
      permitted to use it’."

      "Traditional and assumed definitions of an institution as ‘‘the laws, rules
      and conventions that give a durable structure to social interactions in
      members of a population’’ (Bowles, 2004) tend to reduce institutions to
      conventions."

      "Actually there is a continuum the goes from conventions, to practices and to
      institutions (Tuomela, 2002). And more importantly, convention in Lewis’
      sense can evolve in institutions. "

***** Examples
      " Take this example from Jones and Sergot (1996): in a department the
      signature of the secretary (X term) counts as the signature of the boss (Y
      term)."

      "The function of the chairs depends on their physical features that are there
      independently of any human agreement. However, at the same time, Searle
      argues that functions are never intrinsic and always observer relative. In
      his theory, functions are always ascribed by humans to the external material
      world."

      "Something is usable as a chair even if it is not recognized as a chair,
      however this possibility of being used as a chair will never be actualized if
      somebody does not recognize it as a chair. In this recognition process, the
      agent needs to infer a possible use of the artifact. Notwithstanding its
      intrinsic function, if the agent does not acknowledge its use, the artifact
      seems to lack the status of being fully a chair."

      "Take the institutional action of ‘marrying’. If Paul, the priest, is
      marrying John and Mary such action can be exe- cuted only if there is a set of
      agents recognizing it. The involved agents see the vehicle actions of the priest
      as a token of the Cognitive Type ‘to marry’ (cognitive media- tion). While
      necessary, this condition however is not sufficient. As in the case of ‘acting
      together’ for such an action to have physical effects
      in the world (and so to exist), it is also necessary that the set of involved
      actors act accordingly to this interpretation (treat as). Because they have
      recognized that the institutional action A has already occurred, they
      consequently believe the R obtains, viz. that John and Mary are married (mutual
      belief that R is true). Either the belief that the supra-action has been accom-
      plished or simply its
      reactive interpretation (disposition to behave), trigger the agent to treat the
      vehicle action a as A and so act on this basis (behavioral mediation)."

      "There is a complex hierarchy of levels which involve both formal and
      informal authorities. The formal authority has the conventional power of
      assigning conventional powers (the lawmaker). The informal one assigns these
      powers simply by their behavioral mediation, by acting accordingly to a given
      recognition (the involved participants). The latter is actually more fundamental
      because it is the real support also for the first one. But due to the fact that
      usually the informal authority does not know of having such an objective power,
      it is not able to influence the formal one."

      "The mechanism is stable also because, as we have seen, it is a co-power of
      the involved participants not a single power of any of them. None of them
      individually by deciding not to accept the power of the priest is able to
      prevent all the other from empowering him."

***** Perception
      "It is at least since the late forties (Bruner & Goodman, 1947) that it is
      argued that perception is ‘‘necessarily the end product of a process of
      categorization [. . .] in which organisms move inferentially from cues to
      category identity’’. Such a ‘perceptual semiosis’ is something different
      from the signification process where something stands for something else."

***** Action, Function and Goal
      "An action is always a (supra-)action composed of a vehicle action and an
      external delegated event."

      "A function is ‘‘an external goal placed on a system that results in a trans-
      formation of the structural properties of the system’’. The external goal is
      usually internal to another goal-governed agent, but what is specific
      relative to weaker notions like ‘use’ and ‘destination’ is that the physical
      characteristics of the system are caused by the external goal."

      "However, we also claim that there exist external goals that are not internal
      to any agent at all. ... Finalities are selecting effects that modify an
      organism’s characteristics in a way that will render it more adaptive."

      "A goal can be defined as a sieve used to select the (morphological or
      behavioral) properties of a system such that at time t1 such properties are
      not the result of chance, but of its preceding history (t0) that consists in
      the rejections resulting from the sieve sifting the alterna- tives of a given
      property."

      "The ‘use’ of something is a weaker notion relative to the notion of
      ‘function’. We consider the ‘use’ as the simplest notion of external goal.
      Even if something does not have a function, it can still have a use."

      "We say that such a tool (and of course a proper artifact) provides the agent
      with the physical power of achieving at least one of his goals"

      "However, to effectively have the power of achieving the goal, even an
      artifact with a function needs to be recognized as usable which means that
      the agent is able to infer how the artifact is supposed to be used (rules of
      use)"

      "From this perspective, to say that ‘‘objects that are designed and used to
      be sat on by one person counts as chairs’’ is something more that a simple
      description. A sort of empowerment is present also when agents appropriately
      recognize a tool or an artifact. Conceptualization of arti- facts is a form of
      empowerment.

      "To the eyes of the agents, the tie between the artifact and the enabled
      actions is so strict the ordinary language allows expressions such ‘the goal
      of the knife is to cut’. This common conception treats the action as
      intrinsic to the artifact"

      "An agent has an objective power when, given his goals, he has the internal
      (skills, motivation, etc.), and external resources (tools and artifacts or
      what- ever) and the conditions for action are such that if he acts, he
      achieves those goals."

      "In collaborative activities, there is more than one agent executing the
      necessary vehicle actions {a, b, . . . , n} and each of these vehicles are
      part of the collective action A."

      "It is in fact a communicative action, when one is doing his share in a group
      activity is also emitting a message. "

      "Differently, it is evident that there are a number of institutional
      actions that we perform that are non-intentional. Think of the case of
      murdering. Killing a man and murdering can be two very distinct kind of
      actions. Some instances of the first, in certain conditions, are cases of the
      second. Others are not, a soldier in battle is not murdering even if he is
      killing thousands of men. There are very different collective behaviors when we
      know that a specific soldier has killed an enemy (or even an innocent civilian)
      with the respect to the case that a killer has been discovered in our block.
      However it is very common that in both cases the agents while intending to kill
      somebody do not intend to perform an institutional action that is nevertheless
      performed."

      "In other words, we identify an artifact as a kind of result of an action, as
      something which is done (is brought about) by an agent x in order to
      (intentionally or functionally) be used by another agent y."

      "Traces of actions can be the most basic kind of coordination artifacts.
      Consider the case of some people walking in a park. The unintended effect of
      their walking is to modify the shape of the grass in a way that is visible
      to others."

      " As we have seen practical and coordination uses and functions very often
      coexist. Even if we have distinguished artifacts that have practical functions
      but only coordination uses (i.e. the bottle and glass) from artifacts that
      have both practical and coordination functions (i.e. the emerged path and the
      table), it is out of the scope of this paper to offer an exhaustive typology of
      coordination artifacts."

***** Formal Definitions

      "Let x be an entity instantiated in a sequence of distinct repetitions
      (x1, ..., xn). A sequence of repetitions is defined as a set of occurrences
      of the same entity linked in such a way that each is produced by the
      preceding, and produces the following occurrences (if any) in the sequence,
      thanks to whatever mechanism of reproduction. Let Bx be the set of behaviors
      or characteristics of x, a finality or function can be defined as follows:

      (1) some items in Bx produces effects unintended by, and unknown to, x;
      (2) any item in x that produces the unintended effect is functional, if that
      effect acts through a causal feedback loop on the mechanism of reproduction,
      favoring x’s reproduction, and as a consequence, that of the item themselves.

      ... It has selected and shaped that behavior or morphology to be as it is. "

      We can consider this process as a double empowerment. By recognizing
      artifacts and tools as usable – somehow acknowledging their ‘rules of use’ –
      (1) and by using them
      (2) agents become able to produce new physical effects in the world.
      Because the former kind of empowerment is mediated by the agent itself we
      consider it a process of artificialization.
      Even if the process is individual, it is the agent that produces it by means
      of his (individual) cognitive mediation, and so in the end he acquires
      additional artificial powers."


      "In our model an action A is composed of a vehicle action a and of an
      external delegated event E on which the agent relies to achieve its intended
      results. The action A can be named supra-action to distinguish it clearly
      from the vehicle one."

      "A minimal model of action implies that the agent believes that his action A
      is necessary and sufficient to achieve R (while the vehicle action is only
      necessary) and that he can obtain R by doing A."

      "We can also define the Community C of agents as the non empty set of all the
      agents that can recognize that institutional action. Such a concept of
      community identifies all the agents that potentially can recognize the
      institutional action and that potentially can act accordingly. "

      "From this, it follows plainly that a Group is a subset of the Community
      sharing that institutional Cognitive Type."

      "We have claimed that doing an institutional action A is a co-power of the group
      G. However the involved agents in G believe that Ag1 has the power of A and for
      this reason, assume that A has been executed. From the subjective point of view,
      agents believe that one of them has such a power."

      "Since it is the group that can do the action, it is the group that has the
      co-power of preventing the single agent Ag1. The conventional/institutional
      empowerment is obtained thanks to a functional permission of the kind
      consent. The functional effect of the acting accordingly is that they pos-
      itively interfere with Ag1 reinforcing his belief of having
      the power of doing the action (Ag1 believes that he can do A, he has the power
      of A). It is not simply the belief that he has the power of doing A that
      empowers the agent but also the fact that they act on this basis."

      "Before and beyond an institutional normative system, it is the participants
      that empowers the Priest in doing the action. If the participant Ag4 does not
      act appro- priately on the basis of the belief that the priest can marry Ag2
      and Ag3 and that they are married as a result of Ag1’s action they in fact
      are not married because the priest actually lacks the power of marrying
      them."

      "All the participants believe and assume that he has such power but are
      unaware of the fact that they (as a group and a community) are empowering

**** ABSTRACT
     Recent years have seen an increase in the application of ideas from the social
     sciences to computational systems. Nowhere has this been more pronounced than
     in the domain of multiagent systems. Because multiagent systems are composed
     of multiple individual agents interacting with each other many parallels can
     be drawn to human and animal societies. One of the main challenges currently
     faced in multiagent systems research is that of social control. In particular,
     how can open multiagent systems be configured and organized given their
     constantly changing structure? One leading solution is to employ the use of
     social norms. In human societies, social norms are essential to regulation,
     coordination, and cooperation. The current trend of thinking is that these
     same principles can be applied to agent societies, of which multiagent systems
     are one type. In this article, we provide an introduction to and present a
     holistic viewpoint of the state of normative computing (computational
     solutions that employ ideas based on social norms.) To accomplish this, we (1)
     introduce social norms and their application to agent-based systems; (2)
     identify and describe a normative process abstracted from the existing
     research; and (3) discuss future directions for research in normative
     multiagent computing. The intent of this paper is to introduce new researchers
     to the ideas that underlie normative computing and survey the existing state
     of the art, as well as provide direction for future research.

**** ABSTRACT
     Social simulation is often described as a multidisciplinary and fast-moving
     field. This can make it difficult to obtain an overview of the field both for
     contributing researchers and for outsiders who are interested in social
     simulation. The Journal for Artificial Societies and Social Simulation (JASSS)
     completing its tenth year provides a good opportunity to take stock of what
     happened over this time period. First, we use citation analysis to identify the
     most influential publications and to verify characteristics of social simulation
     such as its multidisciplinary nature. Then, we perform a co-citation analysis to
     visualize the intellectual structure of social simulation and its development.
     Overall, the analysis shows social simulation both in its early stage and during
     its first steps towards becoming a more differentiated discipline.

**** ABSTRACT
     The different ways individuals socialize with others affect the conditions under
     which social norms are able to emerge. In this work an agent-based model of
     cooperation in a population of adaptive agents is presented. The model has the
     ability to implement a multitude of network topologies. The agents possess
     strategies represented by boldness and vengefulness values in the spirit of
     Axelrod's (1986) norms game. However, unlike in the norms game, the simulations
     abandon the evolutionary approach and only follow a single-generation of agents
     who are nevertheless able to adapt their strategies based on changes in their
     environment. The model is analyzed for potential emergence or collapse of norms
     under different network and neighborhood configurations as well as different
     vigilance levels in the agent population. In doing so the model is found able to
     exhibit interesting emergent behavior suggesting potential for norm
     establishment even without the use of so-called metanorms. Although the model
     shows that the success of the norm is dependent on the neighborhood size and the
     vigilance of the agent population, the likelihood of norm collapse is not
     monotonically related to decreases in vigilance.

**** ABSTRACT
     While computer models provide many advantages over traditional experimental
     methods, they also raise several problems. The process of software development
     is a complicated task with high potential for errors, especially when it is
     carried out by scientists holding their expertise in other fields than computer
     science. On the other hand, the process of creating computer simulations of
     social systems which reflect the reality of such systems requires insights
     considerably beyond expertise in computer science. The Multi-Agent Modelling
     Language (MAML) is one of the efforts to ease these difficulties.

     In its current version, MAML is a macro-language for Swarm (a freely distributed
     toolset under development at SFI), but it is also part of a larger
     Swarm-independent framework. Also, the design of MAML, while influenced by
     concepts from Swarm, is general enough to allow for later extension of the
     supported simulation kernels. This paper gives an overview of the mentioned
     larger framework, with special emphasis on MAML and its graphical CASE tool, the
     Model Design Interface.

**** ABSTRACT
     Institutions, the way they are related to the behaviour of the agents and to the
     aggregated performance of socio-economic systems, are the topic addressed by
     this essay. The research is based on a particular concept of a bounded rational
     agent living in society and by a population based simulation model that
     describes the processes of social learning. From simple co-ordination problems,
     where conventions spontaneously emerge, to situations of choice over alternative
     constitutional rules, simulation was used as a means to test the consistency and
     extract the implications of the models. Institutions, as solutions to recurring
     problems of social interaction, are both results and preconditions for social
     life, unintended outcomes and human devised constraints. In an evolutionary
     setting no support is found for the deep rooted beliefs about the 'naturally'
     beneficial outcomes generated by 'invisible-hand' processes or by any
     alternative Hobbesian meta-agency.

**** ABSTRACT
     Agent Based Modeling (ABM) toolkits are as diverse as the community of people
     who use them. With so many toolkits available, the choice of which one is
     best suited for a project is left to word of mouth, past experiences in using
     particular toolkits and toolkit publicity. This is especially troublesome for
     projects that require specialization. Rather than using toolkits that are the
     most publicized but are designed for general projects, using this paper, one
     will be able to choose a toolkit that already exists and that may be built
     especially for one's particular domain and specialized needs. In this paper,
     we examine the entire continuum of agent based toolkits. We characterize each
     based on 5 important characteristics users consider when choosing a toolkit,
     and then we categorize the characteristics into user-friendly taxonomies that
     aid in rapid indexing and easy reference.

**** ABSTRACT
     This paper identifies possible pitfalls of simulation modeling and suggests ways
     to prevent them. First, we specify five typical pitfalls that are associated
     with the process of applying simulation models and characterize the "logic of
     failure" (Dörner 1996) behind the pitfalls. Then, we illustrate important
     aspects of these pitfalls using examples from applying simulation modeling to
     military and managerial decision making and present possible solutions to them.
     Finally, we discuss how our suggestions for avoiding them relate to current
     methodological discussions found in the social simulation community.

**** ABSTRACT
     This position paper contributes to the debate on perspectives for simulating the
     social processes of science through the specific angle of participatory
     research. This new way of producing science is still in its infancy and needs
     some step back and analysis, to understand what is taking place on the
     boundaries between academic, policy and lay worlds. We argue that social
     simulation of this practice of cooperation can help in understanding further
     this new way of doing science, building on existing experience in simulation of
     knowledge flows as well as pragmatic approaches in social sciences.

** The Grammar of Society - Cristina Bicchieri                                 :bicchieri:
    In "The Grammar of Society", Bicchieri distinguishes between a
    number of different strengths of social rules, with norms being
    the most comprehensive. It is useful to lay out, explicitly, the
    variations, to then relate back to institutions, how they
    function, and the types of rules which they employ.
    
    The main classes of rules she identifies fall into the forms:
    1) Descriptive norms,
    2) Conventions
    3) Formal rules
    4) Moral rules
    5) Personal norms
    6) Habits
    7) Social Norms

    She formalises the structure of all these rules as variations on
    characteristics of Contingency, Conditional (both empirical and
    normative) preference, and the existence of related sanctions.

    ,belief, art ,law, morals, custom, and any other capabilities and habits
    acquired by man as a member of society.

    Culture is a humanly directed response to historical events. We use culture
    to change our behaviour and the behaviour of others for personal benefit, but
    the conscious choices that we make are aimed at immediated outcomes.

    Individuals construct self-centered personal networks of power, or 'imperia'
    incorporating individuals and institutionally organized groups of people they
    can personally command or influence to do things for their personal
    advantage.

    Personal power networks are based on kinship, marriage, friendship and

    Extended families are formed when marreied children reside near their

    constitutes an indepenedent domestic unit with its own kitchen hearth and
    garden, but there is daily economic cooperation between households, and fish
    and game are pooled.

    The Ashaninka recognize three categories of people: Kin, formal trading
    parters, and strangers who are potential enemies. If friendly interaction is
    to take place, strangers are immediately placed in a kinship category and
    treated appropriately. For example, men who want to request a favor from me
    would address me as "brother".

*** p43
    One of the most distinctive features of tribal cultures is the way they
    resist any concentration of political power that might threaten the autonomy
    of households and communities.

    Political autonomy means that people can relocate their village whenever they
    choose, can kill intruders in self-defense, and can control their natural
    resources.

*** p45
    An Ashaninka househould network of 100 persons in 26 households in 10
    household groups.

    Amazon villages are "societies against the state, designed to prevent the
    concentration of political power that would allow anyone to gain control of
    the economy for his own benefit.

    A good headman must be a good public speaker and be especially generous,
    giving things away on request, but he is not distinguished by special dress
    or insignias of office. The importance of the headman's oratorical skills
    further shows that he cannot use coercive violence. He must be verbally
    persuasive at settling intravillage conflicts, but if he fails as a
    peacemaker, the village simply breaks apart.

*** p46
    The Ashaninka headman's position is temporary because it is based on his
    personality and the number of his sons and sons-in-law that he can persuade
    to remain in his hamlet to form a local group.

    The underlying source of village conflict is the shortage of game and the
    related competition between village men for access to women.

    In the tribal world there are no central political authorities or
    institutions with police, courts, and judges that could curb offenders,
    settle disputes, and prevent endless cycles of revenge and killing.

* Institutions and Organizations
  by W. Richard Scott
** Introduction
   Origins in the middle of the 19th century.
   Dominated social sciences from 1850s to 1920s.
   Subsided until the 1970s.
*** Questions institutional theory asks:
**** Why do organizations of the same type so closely resemble one another?
**** What specific types of institutions are associated with the rise of organizations?
**** How are we to regard behavior in organizational settings?
     Does it reflect the pursuit of rational interests and the
     exercise of conscious choice, or is it primarily shaped by
     conventions, routines, and habits?
**** What is the relation between freedom and control in social life?
**** Why do individuals and organizations conform to institutions?
     Is it because they are rewarded for doing so, because they
     believe they are morally obligated to obey, or because they can
     conceive of no other way of behaving?
**** Why is the behaviour of participants observed to depart from the formal rules and stated goals of the organization? 
**** Why is it, if formal rules are largely ignored, that resources and energy are expended to maintain these formal structures?
**** Where do interests come from? 
     Do they stem from nature, or are they constructed/inflected by social context?
**** Why and how do formal and informal control structures arises?
     Do individuals voluntarily construct rule systems that then operate to bind their own behavior?
**** Do control systems function only when they are associated with incentives - rewards and punishments - or are other processes sometimes at work?
**** How do differences in cultural beliefs shape the nature and operation of organizations?
**** If institutions regulate and constitute individuals, how can individuals hope to alter the institutions in which hthey are embedded?

** Early Institutionalists

*** Economics
    
**** European
     [p2]
     Schmoller (1900-1904): Historical school: Economic processes operate within a social
     framework that is in turn shaped by a set of cultural and
     historical forces. Argued to shed views on simplistic 'economic man'.

     Carl Menger (1883): Classical approach. Institutions as social phenomena. 
     Possibly (Langlois) the original institutional economist.

**** American
     Veblen, Commons, Mitchell.
     
     Veblen focused on economic change. Focused on individual actors and dynamic models of economy/society.
     Argued against the 'conception of man as that of a lightning calculator of pleasures and pain', focusing on habit and convention.
     Defined institutions as 'settled habits of thought common to the generality of man'.
     *Conspicuous consumption*. 
     Dichotomy between institutions and technology?

     Commons focused on *transactions*. 'The transaction is two or
     more wills giving, taking, persuading, coercing, defrauding,
     mechanisms and rules of conduct'.  
     Institutional rules were necessary to define the limits within
     which individuals and firms could perform their objectives.
     Institutions existing at a specific time are imperfect and pragmatic solutions to reconcile past conflicts.
     They are solutions consisting of:
     1) a set of rights and duties
     2) an authority for enforcing them
     3) adherence to collective norms of reasonable behaviour

     Jacoby: Early institutionalists departed from mainstream approaches in 4 ways:
     1) Indeterminacy vs determinacy
     2) Endogenous vs exogenous preferences
     3) Behavioural realism vs simplifying assumptions
     4) Diachronic vs synchronic analysis (static vs dynamic analysis)
        
     Schumpeter, Polanyi, Galbraith, Myrdal.

     Failed because of *tendency to degenerate into naive empiricism and historicism.*
