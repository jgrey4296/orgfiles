   Polite Fictions | Front/Back Regions


   In the form of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_%2528royal%2529][Royal Court]]?  Ettiquette as a weapon. See
   Norbert Elias, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France][Louis XIV]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali%25C3%25A9nor_de_Poitiers][Alienor De Poitiers]].  Fictional:
   Steerpike Getting into a position of power, where you have
   control of ritual and ettiquette, lets you make the rules.
   Then combine this with the need for laws to be within social
   norms, and the social capability of getting people to agree
   with you when you need them (by way of favours etc), and you
   have the drive and limitation of social laws.
