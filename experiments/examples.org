* Examples of Socio-Institutional Experiences        :software:existingMedia:
** IMMERSE                                                         :research:
   The possibility of Procedural Societies in which you need to be a
   good stranger.  This links with the idea of Sliders, and "Survive
   going down to the shops in a parallel universe" game ideas.
** We Happy Few                                                       :games:
** Gormenghast                                                      :fiction:
** 1984 <-> Brave New World                                         :fiction:
** Macro/Micro Motives. Schelling.                               :nonFiction:
   The example of people filling up an auditorium in particular
   patterns.
   Also the discussion of Southern 'Honor' Systems bringing about
   violence,
   And the differences of what groups sell vs what groups retain
   family farms.
** Law
   No-Drop Policies of taking arrests to trial sound like bad-ai.
