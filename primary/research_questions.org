* Related to Cohen:
    What will happen if you vary an institution?
    Does an institution generated and varied in a procedural way model
    real world institutions accurately?
    Do Institutions explain the changes that can occur socially?
    A number of research questions arise once the concept of SIA
    has been brought to the fore, primarily:

    How can we describe Socio-Institutional Actions?
    Can we create dynamic societies within which SIA's can occur?
    Can dynamic societies provide new media experiences?
    How might we utilize dynamic societies in games?

   #TODO: 2003 onwards
** Adams 2002
    The main aims of the project are as follows: -
    1) Find, or if necessary, create a general system to support the graph
       grammar approach.
    2) Create strategies that generate topological descriptions of levels.
       These levels must:
       1) Be random and vary greatly from other levels.
       2) Have the difficulty and size that were input as parameters.
    3) Develop algorithms to assess the size, difficulty and fun-value of a level.
    4) Develop a rule set that allows interesting, fun to play and differing
       levels to be generated by the Dungeon Generation System.
    5) Investigate the power of context-free graph grammars with regard to
       automatic level generation.

    If time allows, the following will also be done: -
    1) Develop a system to convert the topological level descriptions into
       geometric level descriptions.
    2) Create complete and playable levels for an actual dungeon game using
       levels output by the Dungeon Generation System.
** Artikis 2003
    A more detailed account of the contributions of this thesis is the following:
    1) A critical analysis of existing frameworks for the representation of
       multi-agent systems (with similar characteristics to open computational
       societies) that:
       1) defines a set of requirements for the specification of open computational societies
       2) identifies the extent to which the existing frameworks in the literature
          address these requirements, and
       3) concludes with an outline of a set of conceptual assumptions and
          criteria that need to be met for the specification of open computational
          societies.
    2) A theoretical framework for the specification of social constraints that govern the
       behaviour of the members of societies. The specification of social constraints
       maintains the standard, in the study of social and legal systems, long
       established distinction between physical capability, institutionalised
       power and permission. This specification provides:
       1) An explicit representation of the institutionalised powers of the agents.
          The representation of institutionalised power enables us to define what
          kinds of actions ‘count as’ [85] valid (‘well-formed’, ‘effective’) actions.
          Distinguishing between valid and in- valid actions enables the separation of
          meaningful from meaningless activities (with respect to the society specification).
       2) An explicit representation of the permissions, prohibitions and obligations of the
          agents that enables the classification of their behaviour as ‘legal’
          or ‘illegal’, ‘acceptable’ or ‘unacceptable’, and so on.
       3) An explicit representation of the sanctions and enforcement policies
          that deal with the ‘illegal’ (‘unacceptable’) behaviour of the agents.
    3) A specification of social constraints by means of two action representation
       languages with direct routes to implementation. More precisely, we provide:
       1) A specification of social constraints by means of the C+ language, a
          formalism with explicit transition systems semantics with support for
          the effects (direct and indirect) of actions and default (‘inertia’)
          persistence of fluents from state to state.
       2) A specification of social constraints by means of EC, a formal,
          intuitive and well studied action language.
    4) A computational framework, consisting of two software implementations, the
       Causal Calculator and the Society Visualiser, that:
       1) executes the specifications of open computational societies, and
       2) proves properties of the specifications of open computational societies.
    5) A Description of the ways in which the computational framework may operate
       in the context of simulations or actual executions of open computational
       societies.
    6) A demonstration of the utility of the theoretical and computational frameworks
       by specifying and executing a contract-net protocol and an argumentation
       protocol. An evaluation of both frameworks, in the light of the presented
       case studies, that points out the strengths and weaknesses of these frameworks.

** Berger 2001
    The purpose of this document is to substantiate the following assertion:
    statistical machine learning represents a principled, viable framework upon
    which to build high-performance information processing systems.

** Bryson 2001
    The primary contributions of this dissertation are:
    1) the BOD architecture, and
    2) the BOD development process.
** Doorenbos 1995
    The thesis of this research is that we can solve this problem in a broad
    class of systems by improving the match algorithm they use.
** G Smith 2012
    1. How can we design content generators that support a new paradigm for design?
    2. How does the incorporation of procedural content enable the creation of a new game
    genre?
    3. How can we evaluate and understand a content generator’s expressive capabilities and
    communicate them to designers?

** Hawes 2009
    Our primary objective is to gain a clearer understanding of the role of the
    conversational dynamics of Supreme Court justices. We aim to show that:
    a) predictable high level patterns exist in the conversational dynamics of the
    Supreme Court,
    b) these patterns may be associated with other areas of interest to legal
    scholars such as voting patterns of the justices,
    c) this association between linguistic patterns and judicial patterns may be
    utilized to provide both short term insights
    (i.e. predicting the outcome of a particular case)
    and deeper insights about the behavior of the Supreme Court.

** MacBeth 2014
    1) A review of governance in participatory-sensing applications, identifying a
       lack of governance consideration and user enfranchishment.
    2) An analysis of participatory sensing as a knowledge commons, using the IAD
       framework, in conjunction with a framework for self-organising electronic
       institutions, which provides an architectural and algorithmic basis for
       governance of a knowledge commons.
    3) A general purpose simulation platform for agent-based simulation and
       modelling, Presage2, suitable for the principled operationalisation of a
       model of the participatory-sensing knowledge commons.
    4) A method of manually translating Event Calculus into business rules, and
       an implementation for the specification of electronic institutions,
       Drools-EInst, along with a suite of modules, with which we can implement
       a specification for a self-organising knowledge commons.
    5) An experimental model of the management of participatory sensing as a
       knowledge commons, with which we validate the problem of supply of
       institutions, and identify that proper enfranchisement of users can be
       used to counter greed and self-interest in participatory-sensing.

** Noriega 1997
    I will organize my arguments along three lines:
    1) from the point of view of agent interactions
    2) from the point of view of agent-based applications, and
    3) from the point of view of dialogical systems

** Recski 2006
    1) How can interpersonal patterns of choice observed in the corpus of dissertation
       defenses be represented in terms of the grammatical system as a whole
       (ie: as subsystems of the system)? How may a paradigmatic grammar such
       as SFG be enhanced if probabilities are ascribed to every feature of a system or
       a system network? Can the incorporation of information on the actual patterns
       of choice realized in the corpus be a motivation for working towards a
       probabilistic modeling of language?
    2) Given the very high frequency of occurrence of the mental process I Think
       many questions emerge. Does I Think express lack of commitment to save
       the speaker's face, or is it a device for avoiding straightforwardness and hence a device
       for saving the hearer's face? Is it an expression of uncertainty and tentativeness?
       Can it express authority, or lack of it? Can it be used to open up dialogic space,
       or all of the enlisted functions depending on the situational context?
    3) What is the most common interpersonal strategy employed by committee
       members to ask questions and to give recommendations and/or suggestions
       and how is it realized lexicogrammatically?

** Reilly 1996
    Part 1:
    1) A set of tools for creating believable emotional agents that includes:
       1) a framework for building believable emotional agents,
       2) a default set of emotional processes to provide reasonable default emotional behavior, and
       3) discussions about how to create specific emotional characters within this framework.
    2) A methodology for creating emotions within a broad set of capabilities
       that allows artists to create emotionally rich characters. This methodology
       also enabled me to create models of how to generate emotions that rely on
       perception and motivation as well as cognition. These models can be simpler
       and faster than purely cognitive models
    3) Validation that the tools I have built can be used to create characters
       that users find to be both emotional and believable.

    Part 2:
    1) A two-part methodology for creating believable social behaviors for spe- cific characters.
       1) Part 1 of the methodology suggests a number of important elements of
          personality that should be incorporated into social behaviors in order
          to make them personality-rich.
       2) Part 2 of the methodology prescribes using a minimal amount of
          representation for modeling other agents in the environment.
    2) A set of believable social behaviors that provide:
       1) case studies for explaining the methodology in depth and how to apply
          it in practice,
       2) evidence for the breadth of behaviors the methodology can be used to create, and
       3) examples of social behaviors for specific characters that use small
          amounts of representation of other agents.
    3) Validation that users find social characters build using this methodology can be good characters.

** Tidemann 2009
    Goals:
    1) Design and develop an architecture for musical imitation that is able to
       model and imitate human expressiveness (ie: the groove) when playing the
       drums.
    2) Design and develop an architecture for motor control and learning that can
       be used to imitate human movements.
    3) Design and develop an architecture for imitation of human drum patterns
       that capture the human expressiveness of playing.


    Hypotheses:
    1) Fusing high-level audio signals with visual signals improves the
       performance of the motor system. TEST: Remove the audio signal, and
       examine the performance of the system.
    2) The Motor system will internalize motor knowledge regardless of the
       sequence of movements that was used to train the system. TEST: Test the
       motor system with random permutations of the sequence of movements that was
       used to train the system, and compare the performance of the system when
       testing with the original training sequence.
    3) The musical output of the system should produce imitations that will be
       perceived similar to the originals. TEST: Use human listeners to compare
       the original audio with the imitated audio and classify which served as
       training signal to the imitated audio.
