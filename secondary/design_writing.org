*** An authoring methodology                                                    :methodology:
    BOD would have primitives described, then repeatedly refine each level.
    Instead, have questions, work out from the middle to define inputs and
    outputs.

    Have a hypergraph of institutions of the form: inputs -> Institutional Spec ->
    outputs

    Described by repeatedly asking questions to refine the specification:

    What is the name of the Institutions? What are the core values of {name}? What
    are some Categories / Roles in {name} ? What is the role structure for {name}
    ? What are the performable actions ? What are the goals? What are the jobs /
    permissions ? What can be delegated? What can be parallelised? What can be
    split across sessions? What are the habits? What are the sanctions? What is
    the weighting of values / roles/ categories / goals / jobs /sanctions ? ( use
    heuristic weighting ) What are the physical laws? (unmodifiable rules of
    physicality) What are the communicative acts? What are the regulative laws?
    What are the normative expectations? What are the monitoring / sanctioning /
    disrupting activities? What are the artifacts? What are the artifact
    specification rules? What are the object standards? What are the symbolic
    variations of artifacts? What are the artifacts functional uses? What is the
    IGU in {name}? Person / Role / Group / Institution -> specify Who are the
    incumbents of the institution? Who are the challengers of the institution? For
    each activity, what is its object, what are the tools usable in the activity?
    What community of individuals are involved with the task, what is the division
    of labour? And What are the additional rules beyond that? What is the
    time/space specification of the activities / jobs/ roles ...?


    Carriers: Symbolic Systems, relational systems, activities, artifacts (for
    scott) Pillars: Regulative, Normative, Cultural Cognitive With Institutional
    Entrepreneurs
*** Firefighting as a Game/Sci-fi concept                                       :concepts:
    Mech suits (eg: X-Com) are typically combat focused. Also fire is rarely a
    primary mechanic, but Far-Cry 2 had detailed models of fire spreading. Power
    fantasies don't have to be combat oriented. The image of, after having played
    for hours, finally obtaining a mech suit built for firefighting, making you able
    to walk through walls and ignore fire, when you've been limited the entire game,
    would give the same power fantasy achievement.

    Narratives could easily include arsonists, terrorists, etc.
*** Game Concepts                                                               :games:concepts:design:
**** Institutional Modification                                                 :institution:
***** Society Generator
      See Red Mars / Galactica / Walking Dead / other Post-apocalyptic stories. A
      linear set of challenges which define the rules of a society as it grows,
      which is then simulated afterwards. Eg: The choices of whether to ban or
      allow abortion, limit military control etc in Galactica set up a particular
      society. The difference is obvious when comparing Galactica to Pegasus.
***** Social Leaders
      Designated individuals are Institutional Entrepreneurs, leading the way for
      how others should behave. Trump is an example for bringing out blatant
      racism.
***** Reified Policy Maker
      Red Mars. Democracy connected to the Sims. The King of Dragon Pass. Seeing
      how prescribed, allowed, preferred behaviours shift general trends. Racially
      focused policing, essentially BLM / Police. Modelling agents
      knowing/anticipating the likelihood of positive or negative outcomes from
      interactions with others. Knowledge of minimum and maximum outcomes. If you
      know the worst a situation can get is only so much changes how you behave.
      Polite to people who, in the rules of the system can cause negative
      consequences. Rude to people who can't. Angry at someone going negative when
      the expectation is positive.

***** Observable Democracy
      A Positech Democracy like simulation, but where actions are modelled,
      possibly sims like, that *shows* the consequences of legalising drugs /
      banning firearms / increase in crime etc.

***** Judiciary / Activist Judge
      Generate Criminal / Civil disputes, allow the player to set binding rulings,
      punishments, fines, and restrictions. Define the hierarchy of values for a
      society.

      See also: Graeber: Accounting in defunct Roman coinage / Slaves / Cows /
      Maidens.

**** Situation Models                                                           :situations:
***** Squad Dynamics
      XCom doesn't include interactions between squad members. See MGS5's Diamond
      Dogs, with some soldiers getting put in the brig. MGS's weakness however is
      that the conflicts are left implicit, and aren't shown ever.

      Soldiers joke, get nervous, shell-shocked, tired, and can hold grudges. As
      they get injured, they can get particular scars and prosthetics. The is
      similar to Elevator Conversations.
***** Apartment Block Simulator
      Simulate the interactions between individuals in an apartment block. Could
      think of JG Ballard's High Rise, Dredd, The Grand Budapest Hotel.
***** Elevator Simulator
      Conversations between individuals in an elevator. Dungeon of the Endless.
      Mad Men. The original thought I had from DotE was the awkward but character
      building conversations had going from one level to another. Take that and
      expand it to have connected conversations, interleaving: character, combat
      event recollection and discussion, and vying for social position.
***** Elevator Conversations
      Dungeon of the Endless has conversations in the elevator, that hint at more
      complex modeling. Distrust, blame, optimism etc could all come into play
      during those elevator rides. Characters could refer back to events that
      happened in the level just gone.

      Conversations between individuals in an elevator. Dungeon of the Endless.
      Mad Men. The original thought I had from DotE was the awkward but character
      building conversations had going from one level to another. Take that and
      expand it to have connected conversations, interleaving: character, combat
      event recollection and discussion, and vying for social position.
***** Organisational Promotion Simulator
      Shadow of Mordor, Voyager. Gormenghast. The Night Watch

***** Public Restroom simulator
      Inspired by North Carolina. Simulate Norms related to Bathroom. Parallels
      with Elevator simulator? Such as Design, Occupancy, Organising principle
      (caste? gender? sexual orientation? organisational position? religion?

***** Institution Play
      American Psycho / The Office / Parks and Rec / *Suits* like office games.
      Favours and grudges within bounds, reverting to working together when
      dealing with outside threats.

***** Office Politics
      Similar to the Shadow of Mordor simulator. Inter office squabbles. Who likes
      and dislikes whom.

***** Space Colonies
      2312-like Terraria / Off world Colonies. The fragility of space living, and
      the influence of orbiting planets for travel and trade.

***** Space Journey
      Gateway, Red Mars initial journey.

***** Social Lemmings
**** Institutional Variation                                                    :institution:
***** 'Go to the shops, I dare you'
      Sliders. Bill Bryson - At Home. John Brunner - Stand on Zanzibar. Alfred
      Bester. Rick and Morty take it to the extreme. The idea of life being put in
      situations that are familiar, but which are varied in infinite ways. Some
      major (Philip K Dick: TMITHC. Nazi's won the war), to the very minor (There
      was no Elvis, someone else is 'The King'). Let Money be shells. Everyone
      Greets in a strange formal way. Clothing Styles.
***** Country Differences

      Stand On Zanzibar compares broad descriptions of different countries. This
      could work well in a Positech Democracy style game.
***** Social Roguelike
      Binding of Isaac / Dungeon of Dredmor style game. Generated maps, with
      social predicaments in collections of rooms instead of violent enemies.
      Binding of Isaac style combination of a wide variety of pickups would be
      interesting. Queuing as an example? Very British Problems?

      Games still prefer violence and combat to social interactions. Anne Sullivan
      highlights it, but what does it really mean to have social gameplay instead
      of combat focused gameply? We can look at game dseign, and the systems that
      facilitate player to player social systems in games like Eve Online, and
      what Raph Loster has written about the variety of social gameplay mechanics
      that multiplayer games can use.

      His focus has typically been multiplayer games, but such mechanics should be
      able to be used for AI opponents as well.

      We can also look at how Cif and Versu enable social narratives to be encoded
      and reasoned about in computational systems.

      Going further, we can look at narratives and real world structures that
      describe the social gameplay that interests us.

      Organizations, Institutions, and politics. Red Mars and Discworld. The real,
      and fictional, worlds that exist in other media have no real equivalent as
      yet, but have suh potential.

      One important example is A Series of unfortunate events. A sequence of books
      that are all very simiar, but which the social system that surrounds the
      main characters changes dramatically each time.
***** Newspaper Generator
      A Dynamic form of Papers Please' Newspaper. Just front page, but with a
      headline, a couple of subheadings, a few quotes, links to particular pages,
      smaller topics. Exposes, corruption, scandals, celebrities, the front page
      is definitional of what is 'newsworthy'. So model that society's
      representation of it's own understanding.

***** Censorship simulator.
      Ministry of Truth in 1984, Censors in Media Positions today. The raw feed of
      actual actions, and the ability to choose what, or how much, to let through.

***** "Go Down to the Shops and Buy Some Milk"
      Sliders-style world variation, where the player needs to survive for a
      specified amount of time. Alt: Institutionalized / Normalized violence
      against specific classes of people. Spawn as White / Black / Male / Female,
      and see how behaviours towards you change.

**** Institutionally Aware Design                                               :institution:
***** Socially Responsive RPGs

      Where players have to abide by the norms instead of looting peasants'
      houses. Downton Abbey, Upstairs/Downstairs, and Gosford Park are good
      examples. Social contracts of how a hierarcy behaves. Those upstairs have
      rules to abide by just as those downstairs.

***** At Home
      The variations and peculiarities that Bill Bryson highlights, integrated
      into the Sims.

***** Guild Politics
      Similar to Institution Play. Think Elder Scrolls, and Discworld's Night
      Watch and Wizards. Wizards have rules on how they can assassinate others and
      climb the ranks, Night watch covers the behaviour of the police, and who
      supports whom.

      Also of note: The Night Watch scene of the assassination of Lord Winder.
      Birds eye view of supporters and opposition, with intended steering of
      parties.

      Elder Scroll's Guilds don't particularly get you to do anything. Tithes,
      preferred / prohibited / obligated behaviours etc. See Graeber for the cycle
      of debt that African trader institutions worked within.

***** Monetary - Warfare - Slavery complex
***** Post Invasion Occupation
      Star Trek DS-9. Subjugated populations.

***** Debt
      ie : David Graeber, Debt.
***** Daily Life
      ie: Bill Bryson, Home.

***** Civil Institutions
      ie: Terry Pratchett: The Night Watch, Religion, Wizards, The Post
      Office/Clacks/Bank/Tax Also African Tribes/Max Gluckman/Elias

**** Accidents in Real Life                                                     :accidents:
     The accidents of life. Tripping on the stairs, getting hit by a car, being
     ill. Stubbing your toe, not getting enough sleep. The thousand and one ways
     in which mood and behaviour is shifted tiny amounts by unrelated elements.

     Games do not typically include concepts of accidents. Tripping, falling,
     hitting yourself accidentally. Swallowing food badly. We often fail at being
     human, or will accidentally break. Such events are what add uncertainty and
     stress to our lives. Related: Douglas Adams pseudo fractures.

*** Games Prototypes                                                            :design:

**** General Ideas to Sort


     the court politics of discworld's night watch, of the west wing and house of
     cards, combined with the societal change due to decisions that result in a
     red mars like society builder. If CiF and Praxis represent a
     computationalised model of charismatic power, then it could be combined with
     simplistic rule systems for the legal-rational and moral sides of power.

     Conflict would arise from individuals assessments of how best to use
     resources, what rules to enforce etc, and changes would be brought about by
     making use of the three forms of power to get votes. Thus: computational
     republic.

     There are two sides to this plan. One the one hand is the individual
     interactions that realise power, and on the other is the manifestations of
     that power into societal structures. Games like Prom Week, Wolf Among us, and
     Mass Effect are closer aligned with the former. You don't really need to
     strategise about keeping people under your thumb, or the capabilities of an
     individual you are going to blackmail.

     Linked with this is the emphasis on *time*. in that time needs to progress,
     slowly but steadily, as you manipulate. This is different from there being a
     timer on things. The closest I can think of that gets to this is dead rising,
     or majora's mask. The repeated pattern of days lets you plan things out, but
     in those games only physically.

     If you can daily schedules, then you can plan other actions, such as social
     actions. Set in motion slow mentions of things, train individuals to respond
     to particular cues. (in this way i'm getting towards hannibal style
     gameplay).

     So: Interpersonal Power interactions situated in cyclical time. Charismatic,
     legal-rational, economic, and moralistic among others, as the basis for
     manipulating the institutional structures to get what you want. Imperfect and
     changing information is a must, as is the need for misunderstandings of
     authority.

     FTL crossed with under the dome, difficulties that make you rely on people
     you can't trust, forming alliances for as long as you need.

*** Network Layers, metaphors, and the DCEL

    The dcel is a clear means of representing a 3-layer ladder of abstraction. Vertex <-> HalfEdge <-> Face
    With Voronoi, and tensor based city gen as generators. 
   
    Society is a DCEL of many layers of abstraction.
    CiF showed how to flatten the layers for interactions somewhat.
    Versu showed a different layer structure, of greater range of interactions. 

    I'm trying to get to an understanding of layer descriptions in a similar way to deep learning descriptions.
    To describe particular structures, recombine and open particular transforms of outside data into internal data.
   
   
    inputs --> (--> InputTransform --> (Selection, SelectAll, Gate, Parameterize, Compile, Delay, Store, Retrieve) -> OutputTransform) -> Actions

    This is very like reaktor. Passing signals that carry information in various ways between instruments, voices, that can include standards like MIDI.
   

    Gameplay / Generation of Aletheiometer Output. Combinations of associations.
*** Procedural Society Examples                                                 :examples:society:
**** Streets
     The way streets look, and the composition of them. The width, materials, and
     buildings on the street. Police, homeless, and pedestrian presence.
     Cleanliness, sanitation, parks. Level of technology, cars, lighting. Climate,
     smog. Variation between night and day. Likeliness of terrorism and crime.
     Behaviour of police, sexual harassment, racism, class tensions. Children
     playing. Friendliness of strangers, styles of greeting, and clothing.
     Grouping of individuals. What locations are popular.
**** Newspapers
     Headlines display the values, and ordering of values, of a society.
     England/America: Different scales of scandals vs normal. Small scale spending
     scandals vs massive and accepted 'campaign contributions'. What acts of
     violence are major vs minor. Big headlines for domestic terrorism by
     outsiders, minor headlines for foreign terrorism. Scale of reporting.
     America: big deal out of small terrorist attacks while Iraq has massive
     casualties, which are barely reported by American media. The statements of
     political candidates. The rate of police abuse, and protests. Strange versus
     normal stories. 'Aliens did X' versus 'Tax rates to increase' Calls for
     violence and assassinations, admissions of wrong doing, micro vs macro
     reporting
**** Violence Escalation
     The pathways and steps in which non-compliance is escalated to eventual
     police violence. Ie: Graeber's notes on accessing a school library without a
     student id. Library staff -> School police -> State police. What is the path
     of escalation when you keep saying "No" to someone's demands.
**** Bureaucracy
     To do task X, how many committees, boards, and agencies must you contact,
     forms filled out, licenses obtained, permits applied for, fees paid, studies
     conducted Officials bribed, killed, owed,

     FTL crossed with under the dome, difficulties that make you rely on people
     you can't trust, forming alliances for as long as you need.

**** Rimworld thoughts
     Rimworld, along with Prison architect, have a level of graphical interface
     quit distinct from Dwarf Fortress, URR, the Sims, Versu, and Prom Week. It
     defines a (relatively) small set of physical/viewable information, plus plain
     textual descriptions for non-visually perceivable information. There is a
     defined technical model of physical changes to the world, that characters
     respond to and and interfere with, manipulating the world around them. They
     also have perceptions of the non-visually represented aspects of the world,
     and social concepts.

     (Modal Opportunities: Similar to Sims Smart Objects) (Galactica related: A
     system where you have a simulation running, that searches somewhat randomly
     thought the state space for N number of turns, selects the most interesting,
     and then presents options to the player, those decisions used to dramatically
     influence the simulation, step by step society evolution, creating
     institutions and patterns of behaviour)

     (Sort of Ridcully/Science of Discworld-like: "I only stepped away for dinner,
     the little buggers went all religious, imprisoned the unbelievers, had a
     civil war and now have a memorial every year)

     (Rule systems as layered semiotically? Iconic, Referential, Symbolic?
     (Communicative as a separate category for simulation coherence?))

     Symbolics with different types, consuming tags, rejecting others.

     So:

     Physical World (Searlian Brute Facts) -> Visual Representations (Colour,
     Shape etc) -> Textual Representation (Temperature, Sound, Texture,
     Characteristics, Causal Modal Opportunities from the Technical Model of the
     world)

     Phyiscal World(V+T) -> Causal Technical Model of the World (Brute Rules) ->
     Individuals (Collections of Data)

     Individuals -> Strategy for interaction with the Technical Model (Physical
     Requirements: Eat, Sleep, Temperature) -> Strategies for causal improvement
     of the Environment (Upgrade items, increase efficiency / output, -> Rules for
     interpretation of the technical model into Semiotic/Institutional Facts
     (Monadic Lifting functions of Brute -> Institutional) -> Rules for Pure
     Symbolic rules (Institutional -> Institutional) -> Rules for Symbolic ->
     Brute actions -> Rules for action on other rules (Permissions, Weightings,
     Condition/Consequence modification) -> Known (Brute/Institutional) Facts ->
     Social Influence

     Social Influence -> bleed through of rules from others?

*** Social rule as a hierarchical graph                                         :architecture:design:socialRules:
    In the way that a voronoi diagram sweeps down, differentiating between the beach
    and sweep line, have recursive connections between layers of social rules.

    Rules can describe a net of facts and other rules.

    let:
    F,G,H be distinct grammars of facts.

    R be a set of rules comprised of a tuple r(I,O,S) where:
    I is the input of the rule, as a string of facts in F.
    O is the output of the rule, as a string of facts in G
    S is the symbol string associated with the rule, providing
    additional information about it in language H

    F,G,H could equal, be a superset, or be disjoint from each other.

    Layers can then be formed of distinct layers of rules L,L',L'' etc,
    which are of the form L(R,F,G,H), L'(R',F',G',H').
    such that F' and I' of L' are the same as S and H of L. That is, the output of
    one layer is the input of another layer.

    The first layer's input, F, would be the base facts of the simulating
    system, as would the last layer, R^ that would trigger the simulating
    system to perform actions.

    This can imply the simulating system, the container typically, to be a
    black box of rules itself, whatever they may be. This can imply
    thinking of the super set L" (consisting of all layers) is a loop.

    f(L") = f(L) -> F(L') -> F(L'') -> etc to f(L_last)

    What if there were branches to previous loops:
    F(L"") = f(L) <-> F(L') ...

    With inverse ruleset R#, which would work in the opposite direction:
    r#(O,I,S) = r(I,O,S)

    And the rule engine has an order of sweeps to evaluate and update by:
    Order = [L,L',L,L',L'',L_last]

    CiF has a similar system: Volition rules -> Influence rules -> Actions -> Trigger
    Rules.

    let F_1, the input set for R_1 of L_1, be the set of brute facts, dependent
    on the simulating system. this is also H_j of L_j, the triggering
    layer out of L_n layers.

    All other facts are social facts, but are they all equal? No.
    Differentiate them into different types and further specified layers:

    There can be representable facts F_rep, and silent facts F_sil, as
    subsets of F_1,
    things that present observable differences and unobservable
    differences in the underlying system. The difference between knocking
    on a door and firing radiation through a door.

    There can rule types as well:
    Physical->Physical Rules (Physical feedback, the Simulation blackbox layer)
    Physical->Social Rules (Physically constitutive/definitional)
    Social -> Social Rules (Social definitions, pure symbolic)
    Social -> Social Rules(Transformational, communicative)
    Social -> Physical Rules (Socially initiated actions)

    Constitutive and Symbolic rules could change with only indirect,
    meaning based changes to the behaviour of the system. Favourite
    colours, or shouting when angry versus whispering when angry.

    Communicative rules are distinct, because we rely on some level of
    natural language to be able to understand. (Though James Ryan's
    islanders didn't need that, using a bit mask description of language).

    If there are transformative layers, such as aggregation, weighting,
    or data assembly from multiple sources...

**** Authoring for Layers.                                                      :authoring:
     Be able to define inputs, and ouputs, for a layer, and orders of
     assessment. Specify that inputs for L_1 are a,b,c,d,e.. and the
     outputs are w,x,y,z.

     Then move to L_2, that has w,x,y,z as inputs already, with the
     inputs marked as unused. Any new inputs defined will be recursively added to L_1's output, and
     marked as undefined.Outputs work similarly to L_3.

     Have the system warn of used ouputs, be able to enforce/define types
     of the outputs/inputs, and specify generics, and cross-layer
     facts. Preferences, and recursive changes are also possible.

     System keeps prompting till L_1 input == L_action output

     Transformational layers could be standardised (eg: combine down inputs to
     n [new/defined] super facts), select m from input options, weight
     rules in a bell curve) could be varied in defined ways (curve changes,
     selection number, reset). (Similar to Reaktor system components to
     create a synth).

     A Transformational layer could also be Societal / Individual based
     calculation (ie: Specify the bracketed layers should be run on an
     individual rather than societal, or statistical, or... normative?
     basis).

     A UI similar to Reaktor, wiring together an architecture graphically,
     would be intersting. Or at least part of the system, modularly?
     Treat individuals as 'voices' of the synth?

     Have actions propose their preferred result, as subtext of the
     expression.  Some agents take the initiative, while others are
     Responding agents, and choose among preferred options, but can
     venture out if they desire. Similar to versu approach, but broader?
**** Tyranny notes
     A Similarity with the horus heresy.  Conquest of Kyros vs Crusade
     of the Emperor. Theres a similarity between the Archons of Tyranny
     and the Primarchs of the HH. 
   
     The designation of fatebinder is similar to mass effect, The
     *social* designation of power to decide others fates. Tyranny makes
     it similar to Judge Dredd, making the player a walking embodiment
     of the law, and your interpretation of it is part of the law.  What
     *would* be interesting is having your judgement's influence how
     other fatebinders judge, shifting the overall sense of justice and
     behaviour be close to the players decisions.

     The differences between the two armies contrast well. The rules of
     induction and recruiting, magic use, leader temperament, trophies,
     armor are all used. Gender Balance is actually uniform between them.
   
*** The Authoring Shell and Modal Systems
**** A useful set of pieces to model a complex system:
     That uses:
     1) Static data nodes
     2) Scoped and Global Rules
        collections of rules that apply to categories of relations. [X,i] rules
        get applied to instantiations, [Y,S] rules apply to defined scopes.
        Global, local, descendents, ancestors..., things with a tag T
     3) Instantiation rules
        1 and 2 get towards describing a platonic item. IRs allow 'there are 25
        apples, with the instId of 0-25, in play in the world'. String
        instantiation and modification would fit here to.
     4) FSMs
        Enabling transition systems between states of the local world's
        instantiations
     5) Parameterised freedom

     6) Layers, Gradient Descent, Evolution,
        By Specifying layers and groups with parameterised freedom, be able to
        treat them as nodes in a network, and have them learn, die, mate...


     If you represent all of these with a level of abstraction to get them all
     similar, authoring could become alot easier.
**** A Modal editor, where a node can have the forms:

     1) A Raw Node, with variables
     2) A Node where Children are alternatives. Array/Set/Queue/Stack behaviour
     3) A Node where variables are instantiations.
        Ie: parent's are prototypes or components, and children are existing
        instantiations. Instantiations can be existentially exclusive of a set of
        options, mututally exclusive, complementary, inclusive, indexed.
     4) A Node as a rule, where parents are conditions, children are actions, and the node body holds transforms of bound variables
        Where nodes are the the fluents being tested and manipulated in
        conditions, and actions. Rules would be instantiable themselves, able to
        act in particular scopes, applicable only when attached to an instance
        able to test for instances, and select them by index
     5) A Node as a FSM, where the fsm has states, and conditions as modal children. (An FSM would also be instantiable)
        Instiantiable, and then testable.`
     6) A Node that collects a group of rules into a category, a variation on (2)
     7) A Node that has a defined substructure
        So a prototypical copy of another segment of the shell?
     8) A Node where nodes have modification controlled
        Either permanently, modifiably, depthly or shallowly. Down to specified
        options, or freely.
     9) A Node where change can view positively or negatively, and action taken accordingly?
        Where there is a defined error assessment?


     What does this result in as a semantics and structures for node, that will
     cover everything else?
***** Structure:
      The node would need a unique id, and a dictionary of modes that it fulfills.
      Categories being: Variable-value edges Value-node edges Parent-Child Edges
      Condition-Rule-Action Edges Instantiation-Exclusion-Alternative edges
      FSM-Event-State edges Local-Rule edges Instantiation-Rule edges

**** On Learning Haskell, Monads and Parsers in the right way
     While haskell is great, it is the wrong language to use to learn how to write
     haskell. Javascript is the *right* way to learn haskell, then you add types.

     Although Monads are a type theory concept, they are a *functional* construct.
     By which I mean that although type theory describes and enables monads, they
     only *require* the ability to do first class functional programming. They are
     used as a means to solve a problem, namely, *code repetition*.

     Parsers are the prime area to learn and use monads, and not in haskell. In
     Haskell you get bogged down in the type system. In javascript, you have to
     track it in your head, but also learn the underlying patterns.

     Namely, the ability to pass a function in, and possibly use it, possibly do
     something else, but still returning a result that can be used in a similarly
     chained function. Text -> (Maybe Parse).

     ... Here, follow the example out. expanding out what monads save in terms of
     if tests and hard coding Show why 'return' is better seen as 'lift', to take
     a value, and return the value the input wrapping function can use.

     Parsing shows how to chain functions together. Also, Parsec shouldn't be
     imported unqualified when learning. Everything should . Parsec.<|> etc

**** Red-black heuristic ranking
     Apply a Beachline style red-black tree to ranking/weighting. leaves will form
     a (possibly bin'd) ordering of weights. Don't bother giving the value itself,
     just its relation to neighbours. Red-black keeps it balanced so you don't
     need too many pairings to determine a rank
