** TODO Unit Testing of writing?
   If i annotate sections with meta-data, I could write a unit testing framework for documents
   that looks for particular regexs, tags, sequences, headings etc.

   Such as (using chai like notation):
   document.should.have.a.section('background')
   document.should.mention('fligstein')
   document.section('background').should.mention('bourdieu')
   document.should.have.a.greaterthan.length('10 pages');
   
   document.section('introduction').should.precede.section('background')
   document.section('introduction').should.mention('research questions')
   document.section('introduction').should.have.subsections(3)
** TODO Layered Architecture
   <2017-03-29 Wed>
   CiF has layers but not constitutive rules
   Versu has constitutive rules, fsms, but only one layer

   There are different combinations of:
   constitutive rules,
   aggregations
   scaling,
   selection

   That can be applied in different layers. What would the architecture be for that?
** TODO Heuristic Ranking
   Heuristically compared red/black tree, 
   assumes a single, consistent, complete ordering.

   RB Tree helps minimise the number of comparisons the user has to perform.
   
   should be able to adjust values by shifting them in relation to neighbours,
   in ways similar to the Voronoi Beach Line.

   intersecting tags to determine exclusion?

   selecting societal elements from a pool?
** TODO Soundscape generation
   combined or separate from streetgen,
   supercollider mixing of various samples, 
   structure out into: background, midground, foregground.
** TODO Shell Node MetaGraph
   node/event/state/fsm/instance/rule,
   all with inputs, and outputs

   Rules: conditions can test on any other morphism?
   how would that be encoded in EL?
   .x.y.[instance].$id.name.$x?

   instance semantics?
   to select a particular concept: .person
   to select an instance of a concept: .person(instance)?
   instance of an instance? 

   modal morphism operators?
   types of rule: instance -> existence -> ground?

   instance, exclusion, transition, condition, action, rule, instantial structure
   existence, ground.

** TODO the state and individual stakes
   the state as an automatic link from an individual to supreme
   authority you have a say in
