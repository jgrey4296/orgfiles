* Intergalactic Robots                                    :concept:storyIdea:
  In Person of Interest, there is the moment when Root says :

  "What if humans have come as far as they are going to go? I want to see what
  comes next."

  Consider a Sci-Fi universe where that is the case. Where Interstellar
  travel is effecitvely impossible for organic creatures.
  Species do, however, get to a level of development to send artificial
  intelligences out into the universe.
  Those robots would, if the last thing a race did was create AI before
  it destroyed itself. Those AI's would go out, find each other, and
  have to adapt themselves to intermingle and co-exist.
