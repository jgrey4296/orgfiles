* A war beyond belief                                                           :scifi:concept:writing:
  Thoughts on a war with no fatalities. An alien invasion that does not kill.
  It captures children(?) and when soldiers are sent to protect, the
  aliens force them to hole up ina location, then  they fire nano-swarms that
  envelop an individual. Suspends them in mid air, strips them, and
  slowly flay them. Don't let the soldiers interact with the victim,
  they slip off if they try to grab them, the swarm eats any bullet the
  soldiers fire to put the victim out of their misery. Soldiers are
  forced to listen and stay with the victim for hours, until the swarm
  finishes, with the victim still alive.
