* Cleaned Notebook notes

** perl book
   What the perl book says on context is very interesting. reread.
   in connection with thinking about monads: a non-agent based, or hive
   mind social model could think of behaviours and context as something
   similar to the maybe monad?
   in that:
   ---->Action::Wave
   behaviour::greeting -----|
   ---->(Maybe) Modifier::Angry

   With modifiers defined to modify a particular place in the list
   structure, all, some, add or delete...


   So represent conflicts as logical expressions, rather than as static
   values. What would the difference be between this and a resource
   manager? individual requirements for individual behaviours. So a
   behaviour conflicts if.... what?

** Questions

*** Confusion
    How about confusion arising by occasionally taking a different meaning parent from which he is meant to?


    If meaning is a chain of contexts in a graph, confusion is taking a
    different parent (as each indivudal node will have multiple
    parents. Furthermore, a single named concept might have multiple
    parents and completely different scopes, but which can get crossed
    easily. Achieve this through.... applying context by passing in
    context which limits to that contex unless confusion is selected)

*** Dishonesty

    dishonest, or just not knowing the social practise your
    in?

    Dishonesty is lying, is a lie a social practise, or a strategy in a
    different practice? This speaks to both my wonder about the modularity
    of praxis' social practices. Additionally, it speaks to me on a level
    about how acts are `lifted' to gain additional meaning.


*** mixins

    mixin behaviour $\Rightarrow$ subset: call different
    things by different names?

    for this i should look at the component papers ive found. give every
    behaviour a set of standard ``plugs'' such as:
    \item pre-start (implicit)
    \item start group (populated with behaviours)
    \item s-m group (implicit)
    \item mid group (populated with behaviours)
    \item m-e group (implicit)
    \item end group (populated with behaviours)
    \item post-end group (implicit)
    These assume a sequential behaviour, though similar annotations could
    occur in parallel behaviours such that there are a group of
    ``complementary'' actions, and ``important'' actions.

    If this is the case, why not just make it so you can look for
    behaviours as a whole? regex or something?

    This is too free, it doesnt allow structure. What is preferable is
    being able to specify ``slots'' in a behaviour to act as targets. Thus
    you can spawn a behaviour somewhere specific in a tree, and somewhere
    specific in a behaviour.

    Why not have rules then to allow use of the slots at specific times?

    In the form of microtheories that turn on and off different slots,
    that are populated by other behaviours? So something like:

    lift (BEHAVIOUR) => EmoBeh;
    bind (emoBeh, sadFunc) => sadBeh;

    Lift turns on particular connection points, bind combines available
    actions into those connection points.


    For conversation understanding:
    lift (speech act) => conv_act;
    bind(conversationAct, cntxtFunction)
                 => cntxtConvAct;

*** tree monads

    226:How would monads \emph{work} and be written in a tree based language
    like nail and abl?\\

    As mentioned above. Specifically in terms of Trees, it would require
    that lifting and binding did not interfere with other tree operations,
    didnt remove nodes that were executing... what else? What are the
    composition rules for behaviours?

    Retain order?, annotate actions appropriately, retain (modified)
    meaning, conflicts are resolved, doesnt get into an infinite loop?
    dependencies are respected.

*** function composition

    233:composition of functions, so different axioms would need to be
    defined?

    monads are a triple consisting of a type, a lift function, and a bind
    function. They respect left and right identity and are associative:

    Bind(Lift(e), k) = k;
    Bind(m, Lift) = m;
    Bind(m, x => Bind(k(x),
            y => h(y))
    = Bind(Bind(m, x => k(x)),
            y => h(y));

    So a behaviour monad would be a triple, of a behaviour type, a lift
    function and a bind function:

    Lift: behaviour => monad behaviour;
    Bind: (monad behaviour,
           (behaviour => monad behaviour))
                      => monad behaviour_b;

    So the main monad would be an alterBehaviour monad. Lift a behaviour
    up to have sockets, and apply a function that adds actions into the
    sockets. Behaviours could be repeatedly lifted and bound with further
    annotations.

    A speech interpretation monad would be as follows: Lift a low level
    speech act to be a speechMonad. Bind an interpretation function that
    adds to the monad the appropriate context. repeatedly bind
    interpretation functions.

    no. context is not represented as an object, it is the functions and
    only the functions. They are called and modified every time an
    interpretation needs to happen. Possibly in a microtheory format.

    So how would the speech monad be used? Pass in a speech act, apply the
    monad, to lift to a type that can interpret/parse the base level of
    meaning of the speech act. look at the meaning of the sentence so far,
    and add a interpretation function based on that understanding.

    interpretation functions could: add understanding nodes to the
    context, add or delete conversational obligations, add or delete wmes
    from the episodic memory, add or delete clauses from the
    sentence. create queries for the working memory, substitute words into
    the sentence...

*** speech acts

    So what are the effects of a speech act on the reciever:
    \item add nodes to context
    \item add obligations
    \item add memories/information
    \item add delete or substitute clauses from the sentence
    \item queries working memory
    \item change state
    \item modify context node
    \\\\\\
    And on the sender:
    \item Transmit a piece of information
    \item Transmit an obligation
    \item Ellicit emotional response
    \item Declare Something
    \\\\\\
    Axioms of Conversation:
    \item (A Says B) =\textgreater (A Knows B)
    \item (A Hears B) =\textgreater (A Knows B)
    \item (A Declares B as C) =\textgreater (Current-Context (Rule A to B))
    \item Obligations must be resolved
    \\\\\\
    Types of ``thing'':
    \item Person
    \item Object
    \item Time
    \item Place
    \item Emotion
    \item Concept
    \item Memory
    \item Action
    \item Sequence
    \item clause?
    \\\\\\
    Things you can say about a thing:
    \item where it is
    \item who or what it is
    \item components of it
    \item when it is
    \item what came before or after it
    \item tense
    \\\\\\
    Elements of a Concept:
    \item Form of / linking
    \item volition assessments /rules
    \item language use
    \item ranking types
    \item working memory references
    \item parents
    \item children

    Manipulations on the Conversation Grammar:
    \item add or remove edges from the finite state machine of
      conversational actions
    \item expand single statements to multiple statements
    \item reduce multiple statements to single statements (ie saying n
      mean things can be reduced to ``being mean''. or is this a
      perception monad?)

    Manipulations on the Cultural Grammar:
    \item add or remove parents and children
    \item modify global hierarchy of concepts
    \item modify local hierarchy of types
    \item modify rules etc


    This could be, without too much difficulty, turned into a bnf grammar?


    understanding nodes consist of substitution rules for words/children
    to change the sentence/add another track of meaning, and also to add
    or remove potential nodes into the available language? these can all
    bottom out in a speech act


    what it seems to come to, is that richard evans doesnt go far
    enough. With a language like exclusion logic, have a conversion
    between sentences and the logic, and have substitution rules as
    metaphors and cultural understanding. But not just editing rules, have
    it changing state, creating collections etc etc.


    Dissonance between act and meaning/speech and movement/different
    layered meaning: as a choice, recognised and used for sarcasm possibly.

*** text search based meta behaviour?

    If i let the user use regex's to determine what to modify would that
    be helpful?

***    255:generalization /type/token?

    Richard evans distinction between types and tokens. need to look
    again, differentiate between types and tokens in socio-ins stuff.

***    257:socio-institutional forms?

    see above

***    260:Dunbars number of people you can know?\\

    Limit the size of agent somewhat. while this shouldnt be a major
    difficulty with even naive memory loss algorithms, its good to remember.

***    263:institutions as a process rather than as data?\\

    This is a big one, how to represent the dynamic processes of
    socio-insitutional activities. Different ones interact in particular
    ways. Should I leave this to be dynamic, or have... more abstract SI
    monads that enable interactions between institutions?

***    269:cif style volition in nail?\\

    multiple rules giving a large number of volitional variables. how
    would this change preconditions? Turn it into auto refactoring of
    tests to make microtheories from preconditions?

    Also, if volition is to be used, where will it be used? Replace the
    abt with access to everything, straight cif? or use volition to
    resolve the conflict set instead of priority? both?

***    272:democracy -\textgreater facism?\\\\

    What is the \emph{process} by which democracy can become facism. Where
    are the patterns, and how do you represent that in a model?

*** ways of conceptualising? multiple reference dictionaries?


    ``milton model conversational postulates'' -\textgreater questions
    with yes no answers that evoke a behavioural response.

*** built in primitives? person? object? entities?
    How do I decide upon the atoms of the model? An extensible symbol

    what is the difference between being a jerk, and being selfish,
    dishonest, or just not knowing the social practise your in? :

    this links to types of players:
    some people play within the system, going for the outcome they
    want. some people play outside the system, to do things that don't
    make sense or shouldnt be allowed. And there are people who don't see
    the system, who play within and without the system. Finally, there are
    griefers who play the ``worst'' or ``more annoying'' action possible.


    mixin behaviour $\Rightarrow$ subset: call different things by
    different names?

    Mixin's are problematic without being able to know where to mix
    something into. This could be done with some sort of latching point,
    scheduling, or conflict declarations, or named locations within a
    behaviour that can have things mixed in, and of what type. Otherwise:
    monads.

*** Monads:
    The idea of a monad is potentially really useful for behaviour based
    AI. If implemented, it would allow a base behaviour definition to be
    created, and then lifted to include new functionality contintually,
    allowing your ``greeting'' to be supplemented and lifted with
    ``unhappy'', ``quiet'', and ``with a red balloon''.

    How would monads \emph{work} and be written in a tree based language
    like nail and abl?

    You would need to be able to take a behaviour, and amplify it into a
    different behaviour. So: ``Greeting'' ==\textgreater Sad
    behaviour(greeting).

    Bind is the tricky one. Composition of behaviours is not the same as
    composition of functions, so different axioms would need to be defined?


    This would involve taking a greeting, and modifying each step to
    incorporate whatever ``sad'' is defined to be. (possibly have
    predefined tags in behaviours: ``pre'', ``post'', ``main''. These
    could cover a number of subgoals as one, and when lifted, a behaviour
    would replace some or all of the defined tags with the corresponding
    tagged behaviour? it would preserve the tags such that you could life
    multiple times.

    You would also need to be able to transform any operations done on the
    original type to the new type.

    Finally you would preferably want to extract the original type out.


*** text search based meta behaviour?
    If meta behaviours modified the source code rather than intermediary
    code, they might be more powerful?


*** generalization /type/token?
    Where am I in terms of understanding types and tokens with respect to
    socio-institutional forms?

*** dunbdar?
    Dunbars number of people you can know?


*** institutions as a process rather than as data?
    The first instinct is to represent an institution or organization as a
    data structure, even though all the interesting elements in it are
    actually processes that describe the interactions.

    monads? lifting a social practise to include another?

    heideggers 'public mood'?


    if insrules provide desire independent reasons for action, what is the
    selection heuristic to choose between a social practise action and
    something you actually desire?


    deeper meaning? coreferences?

    how do we differentiate between breaking social practice and mental
    illness?

    Status function declarations enable particular social practice?
    charaters $\Rightarrow$ roles $\Rightarrow$ social practices
    \textlesser- status function declaration

    institutions as networks of SFD's and roles?

    design patterns of social actions?

    recap: conversations represented as a collection made of:
    statement-tree, meaning graph, obligation set. what else?
    would there be a social practise graph as well?


    which is it: actions make and start the social practise, or the social
    practise starts and makes the actions?


*** socio-mimetic vs socio-intuitive? (off swen - biomimetic):
*** cross-heirarchical coincidence?
    So similar patterns occuring on different levels of a
    hierarchy. Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is an example: Arthur Dents
    home being demolished, and the earth being similarly demolished.

   difference that im going for (Chess / cif / praxis) against (Go /
   SIAQ). a much subtler game...

   chains of insRules causing conflict, a reverse tree of interpretations

   insRules need to have boundaries


   personality as flailing cords. Desires without release. Tentacles that
   will latch to available realisations.

   call and response based langauge where its not \emph{what} you say but
   the modifications you make to the previous sentence that imparts meaning

   Expectation set.


   cultural views on emotion $\Rightarrow$ personal experience.
   $\Rightarrow$ social-insitutional \emph{understanding} rather than performance.

   interpersonal vs institutional obligations

   Relational opinions: define everything in terms of modifications of
   YOUR state. So you dont say what Bob believes or knows, you modify
   what you know to arrive at your understanding of Bob's state.

   \emph{This raises an interesting concept: defining an individual as a
   process rather than as a structure, such that at every moment you
   are figuring out what to do. Perception (not sensation) becomes
   crucial. The ways in which you interpret incoming information offers
   additional social practises. Thus, reading an article, i can agree or
   disagree with each sentence as I read it. This can be used to group
   all the opinions together, giving me an opinion of the newspaper
   article as a whole. By processing the article, I have generated an
   opinion. If that opinion is held strongly enough, and I am the sort of
   person to do so, I can decide to write an opinion letter to the
   newspaper, interpreting it as a conversation rather than a
   broadcast. I don't have a ``check to see if i have a strong enough
   opinion to send a letter'' precondition on a behaviour, the behaviour
   is instantiated due to something else triggering. }

   to arrive at someone's view of someone else's view do it for each
   step:
   Bob $\Rightarrow$ Bill $\Rightarrow$ kate $\Rightarrow$ joy's view on something.

   so the operations are:
   \item Bob(B) creates Bill's(BI) relational mind(BIRM)
   \item BIRM creates Kates(K) relational mind(KRM)
   \item KRM creates Joys(J) relational mind (JRM)
   \item JRM generates an opinion.

   at each stage, based on all information of the target, remove (and
   maybe add (possibly ``templated'' knowledge rather than the actual
   thing) information to a clone of your mind, which can recurse to the
   necessary level. Then its a case of retrieval.


   {positions, roles, norms, values} $\Rightarrow$ social structures
   $\Rightarrow$ stable patterns of human acitvity $\Rightarrow$ plsr, ri,
   svss. (see above).

   change from a hivemind architecture of cif and praxis to agent based,
   as i need everyone to have their own understanding. (this can be
   instantiated at the start by randomly adding/subtracting meanings, or
   generating new ones to add some variation). when doing opinion
   inference you assume people are exactly like an existing model,
   usually you, plus or minus particular things. But it doesnt have to be
   based on you. You could store the manipulations as separate models. In
   which case a couple of things. Firstly, manipulations will need to be
   somewhat exagerated because its inference. Secondly, You could do
   reinforcement learning or something, thus you infer better for
   particular people as time goes on. You could also use these models for
   new people based on your expectations of what sort of person you will meet?

   ins rules as metaphor to modify an S.P. ie: argument as war offering
   particular options and ways of describing something.

   to think of the opinion of someone else is to think of your opinion
   and then modify it with what you believe about the person you are
   focusing on.
   Thus: Bob thinks Bill doesn't like Kate.
   Is: Bob thinks (Bob's opinion of kate modified by what is known and
   thought of Bill).

** Social Models

   both low level, speech act type communication ability, up to
   institutional manipulation.

    %different levels of capability to commit the crime, of personal
    %volition, ability, and the correct free time.


    %desired elements of a social model:
    The desired elements are at least:
    \item expanded desire formation to account for longer term goals
    \item institutional facts. use and creation  for higher level meanings
    \item micro-theories for mixed social/non-social actions -
      microtheories and conflicts in some form?
    \item templated quests - or not. Instead select a desire to be made
      real.
    \item institutional chain quests + planning
    \item mod CKB, situtational CKB (this is actually like praxis)
    \item expanded multi-agent conversation ability. using ins facts.
    \item time, perception, action selection integration
    \item dynamic rules
    \item multi-volition games
    \item lower level control of conversation (speech acts)


**** Turner
     Turner on social institutions:

     a complex of positions, roles, norms and values lodged in particular
     types of social structures and organizing relatively stable patterns of
     human activity with respect to fundamental problems in producing
     life-sustatining resources, in reproducing individuals, and in
     sustaining viable social structures within a given environment.

     so:

     \item a complex of 
       \item positions

         \item norms
         \item values \end{itemize}

   hale - COIN dissertation.

   institutional rules work for static structures, but how to describe
   \emph{dynamics} of institutions.

   markov chains?

   deontic rules are independent of character. microtheories are
   intrinsic to character? or are they the same? certainly i need to come
   up with a method of making rules personalised.

   microtheories provide volition, deontic rules are desire/volition
   independent?

   change microtheories to incorporate description of patterns of
   SAS/conversations/Social games.

   differentiate character statuses from institutional statuses?

   micro-schemas in a similar way to microtheories? small partial plans.

   different organisations are characterised by different institutional
   rules:
   \item 1 to 1 interactions.
   \item many to 1
   \item 1 to many
   \item many to many
   \item hierarchical
   \item non-hierarchical
   \item equal reciprocal
   \item unequal reciprocal
   \item unidirectional
   \item non-directional

   status as rule of behaviour versus prohibition?

   \item descriptive
   \item targeted
   \item nontargeted
   \item declarative
   \item procedural?
   \item prohibition
   \item reactive
   \item proactive

   insrules countas relationship, use tree compression algorithm?

   the ``function'' part of status functions


   desired:
   \item no story manager
   \item conversation through an intermediary
   \item understanding of larger contexts: taking part in an S.P to get
     to one you want? (defined S.P flow?)
   \item subversive use of S.Ps
   \item s.ps that change/grow more complex/ have changes in popularity
   \item balance of constitutive and regulative rules
   \item social standing determining the S.Ps available
   \item fluid gender
   \item orders
   \item S.Ps are only the top of the activity theory pyramid, what about
     division of labour, collaborative S.P's, dynamic grouping?
   \item delegation?

   ins rules to enable instantiation of social practises?

   independent requirements for the sp itself, defines whether an agent
   has the ability to initiate?

   speech acts $\Rightarrow$ very low level
   S.P $\Rightarrow$ low level external influences
   ins rules + sfd $\Rightarrow$ mid level
   character arc $\Rightarrow$ high level internal

   insrules +sfd $\Rightarrow$ allow use of different actions in place of
   others (pain for pleasure?)

   compare the length of a insrule chains to resolve amount of power
   differences?

   combine insRules with personality, then mix in elements that are to
   the characters benefit in their actions. Thus:
   masochist $\Rightarrow$ pain, so
   (beating \textgreater pain) $\Rightarrow$ greeting

   insrules enabling s.p's for groups/guilds/companies.
   (how to represent groups/guilds/companies? as data structures or
   processes? separate agents? lists of membership? structures of goals
   and members? some sort of process seems appropriate)

   replace s.p's with other ones, parts of others, or
   shortened/lengthened s.p's.

   have s.p's be defining some of the ordering and options and chaining
   context, while the conversation is generated at a lower level?

*** CiF-RPG
    the differences between the two

** Praxis

   episodic memory? how do agents remember previous events.

   how do power relations work in praxis? meekness?

   how would a play party work?

   how much agency does an agent have?

   how could versu deal with two people in a conversation, and someone
   wandering by and joining in? + confusion, talking at cross purposes

   1 to 1 conversation all good. What about 1 to many: ie: a press
   conference. Its not many 1 to 1 social practises, but they act in that
   way. just one of the roles is filled by many people.


   versu has difficulty with non-symmetric relationships like those more
   in poly.

   what about actions outside of S.P's? or unexpected norm violations,
   sudden shifts etc.

   swapping in and out different SP's?

   how could praxis do a nefarious plan?


   need to specifically author norm violations

   ``processes''/social practises: how does it deal with failure,
   recover, and coordinate on a longer scale?

   social practises are constitutive rather than regulative. how does
   this contrast with behaviours?

   countying?

   top-down instantiation of social practises. What would a bottom up
   form look like?

   can't really deal with conversations that have an intermediary?

   \item assumes agents are in the same practise?
   \item has difficulty with sudden shifts of social practise?
   \item uses desires for action selection, SP's should also exert influence?
   \item doesnt allow for S.P's to be used in novel ways, or in
     subversive ways?
   \item hierarchical S.P's
   \item parallel behaviours, defined sequences, repair etc?


   core model of beliefs, emotions, relationships and evaluations.

   how does praxis manage continuity?

   still requires large amounts of specific authoring

   generation of new social practises as reskins of old ones?

   exclusion operator is problematic re gender.

   authoring norm violating actions.....hmmm

   has ``official'' long term relationship status. hmmm.

   player reactions important.



   characters look at actual consequences, perfect forward
   knowledge. this is not ideal.

   quantified wants/desires/preconditions



   sees the entire simulations state, no hidden information

   short term planner, so how are longer plans realised?



   Can praxis have a rule of the form: let there be a hostile group of 3
   people+ who are collectively non-violent with a power struggle
   potentially?

   also praxis could do status function declarations? dynamically linked?
   language needs to generate those sort of sfds

   richard evans has talked about type/token distinction and scorekeeping
   for social practise state. Isnt this what Praxis is doing despite his
   argument against?

   how much is just scorekeeping?

   multiple instances of social practises but only one of each character?
   what about the other way round?

   is there a union of character, role, and concept of character.

   or concept of character != role?

   deterministic

   architecture of praxis:

** NLG


   Conversation:
   with conversation as a tree, and graphs for meaning, someone could
   join a conversation by just instantiating a conversation with only the
   heard elements history, and no local scope meanings instanced. thus
   confusion could arise.

   socio-mimetic: paradigm inspired by social systems. socially
   cooperative agents. for SYNTHESIZING SOCIAL SYSTEMS.

   cif: assess motivations, use them to select from all actions
   praxis: assess motivations, select from active social plays
   abl: manage tree of active behaviours, step through them.
   nail and siaq: ?


   multple authoring of conversation components:
   \item script for social practices, supplemented by:
   \item generalised speech acts, that connect with a previous statement,
     combined with:
   \item commissives, directives that try to change the world in
     beneficial ways for the character.


   directive for e to tell x to a (e: a person; x: a statement; a: a person)
   a but not e  have memories that have the entire conversation from their
   point of view. e has his own conversational history with the player
   and a.

   Thus: hmm, if conversation is a tree, then its recoverable after the
   conversation, or able to be instantiated without being talking to a
   person. when you get something that can count in that sentence,
   specifically if you are told its part of it, then you add it on in the
   right place. a stack like operation is what im thinking here.



   x $\Rightarrow$ tempory state of a particular SP + a + history of
   communication.
   respond, as a directive


   Sam Vimes sighed - ``Person'' did ``something'' (action)
   when he heard the scream, - when ``something-2'' (event) (something
   AND something-2 generalised to similar time frame)
   but - set up opposition
   he finished shaving - one event (think on gant chart dependencies)
   before - happened and finished
   he did anything about it. - waiting/cued event. generalised.



   (remembering: ``i don't believe we've met'' - so there is the event
   ``we've met'', which can be inferred not to have happened if there
   isnt a memory of you. This is not guaranteed unless there is a
   reference to the person in knowledge of them, without a corresponding
   lack of meeting. this can then be negated in two different places -
   the don't believe, or the we've met.)

** Activity theory

*** Circumplex
    McGrath

** Quests

   if rather than templated quests, we were to go the praxis route of
   defined statements that a character would/does want, then a quest
   could be a simulated series of positive steps *plural*, with just the
   final one given. Thus, the player is given a goal state that is
   somewhat distant but certainly possible, they can then cock it up as
   they like.

   i would argue that quests have typically had a techno-economic focus,
   or a marlistic focus, or an interpersonal focus, none of which are
   particularly socio-institutional.

   a post-structuralist aproach to quests?

   is there any character transformation really in quests?

   type and token distinction in quests?

   burn notice as odyssean dramatic structure?


   quests in grailgm: either relationship or status(items/knowledge)
   quests.

   Desire $\Rightarrow$ activity
   intent $\Rightarrow$ goal
   performance $\Rightarrow$ operation

   burn notice style delays $\Rightarrow$ rhythm generator???

** Nail

   finger trees seem potentially useful.

   cheaper and faster to author hopefully
   better suited for mixed tree and volition based ai also?




   status function objects?

   non-sequential plans/behaviours that have steps you dont care about?

   preconditions as generalised micro-rules that change weighting?

   how to go about biinding?

   preconditions will likely need a rete network

   Numerous steps: Define Grammar, implement parser, write operational
   semantics, write runtime. VARIABLE SPEED


   Workflow for nail:
   \item Startup
   \item Define WMEs
   \item Define Base Actions
   \item Add behaviours and WMES
   \item Update runtime as new behaviours and WMEs are added.
   \item Define ``Missing'' behaviour actions

   needs to be able to reuse code/ start developing libraries of behaviours


*** Language Elements
    behaviour modifier: ``exit condition'' to replace persistence? similar
    to success test

    behaviours returning values

    inline parallel only

    variables valid anywhere, if unable to access instantiates a default
    value

    for class vs instance variables, BBAI alternative is... declaration vs
    tree variables

    a ``next'' variable? what would this do?

    default ``not found'' behaviour

    What would a chuck like use of time be like in nail?

    joint parameters allowing roles? write the behaviour that directs all
    roles in one behaviour?


    some sort of standardised priorty system? This relates to the conflict
    set idea of having it as a priority queue with countdowns of how long
    before an option/behaviour times out.

    praxis is allowing the role-modified joing behaviours that ABL cant
    do.
    parallel sync control would be useful here.

    define minimum duration of behaviour? implicitly wait if behaviour
    goes too fast? this could negate the need for successtests and waiting

    use a tag system? information foraging?

    hotswapping of behaviours in specific agents?

    scope of dot operator?

    using integers for whole priorities, floats for relative?

    probability modifier for selection? similar to volition.


*** Meta-Operations

    This needs to be more powerful than abl. Not sure what to do here.
    Have a better interface for mixins, mixOUTS? mod behaviour for
    specific places on the tree, remove from tree? PAUSE? escape/cleanup behaviours?

    fold behaviours together with overlapping actions?

*** Operational Semantics

    yeah this will take a while



*** implementation details

    obligational priority queue. methods of selection and planning are a
    form of personality?

    \item an adaptive priority queue. in order of number of turns left
      before social action time out. agent takes n actions each turn. with
      various strategies. greedy, non-greedy, optimal, etc etc.
    \item conversation trees. backtracking has different strategies. dfs,
      bfs, random, forgetful. post order, in order.....
    \item imperative versus ASP. defining how to get something versus what
      the end thing must look like. so ASP is to imperative programming as
      BLANK is to abl coding?
    \item what the british say vs what the mean. perfect example of
      interpersonal institutions, underlying model represents ``hello how
      are you today??'' as a performative becomes ``good morning''.
    \item british ``how are you?'' expects ``fine''. It is an exchange
      that can be completely discarded, unless something meaningful is
      said. at which point ``fine could mean many things across
      participants. a1 $\Rightarrow$ i'm good $\Rightarrow$ find
      $\Rightarrow$ meh $\Rightarrow$ a2.



    two separate data structures for definitions and instances? put
    execution into the definitions, instances hold symbol tables

    uses prototype pattern? or would if it was better in java. As is, have
    instances on the tree, which all reference a definition. If that
    definition is changed as part of the behaviour, define whether its
    global or temporarily modified.

    have definitional vs instancial preconditions?

    multi-part conflict set creation?:
    protoypes $$\Rightarrow$$ potential elements based on ``next'' values of current
    leaf nodes $$\Rightarrow$$ conflict set

    hierarchical variable search: up the tree, or up definitions? or
    specify search root/path

    treat nodes as clauses on the tree?


    preconditions: clauses aren't necessarily AND linked, they could be OR
    linked, or treated as a tree/chain in themselves, allowing simple
    actions to flip conditions on or off? Then if its too big, cleanup?
    some amount of planning representation here could be useful

    parsing: literally line by line? hmm. a REPL would be useful

    differentiate between syntax tree, compiled object representation
    tree, and the ABT? on this point it got more complicated when i added
    in the type system

    mental acts: gone. prefer to do everything internally to nail

    \emph{haskell}

    linking the object representations with the relevant code somehow?

    trying to make literally everything a variable. both implicit and
    inline explicit?

    using a stack of hashmaps to deal with scope of symbol tables? or
    actually just go up the tree?


    Obj-C like syntax for pass parameters. ie: subgoal name (ParamB:
    value);

    Assume step mods, but allow them to be passed in in the subgoaling as
    well: subgoal name (Priority:3);

    Return values: syntax to extract values returned?

    Synchronisation: specify if parallel behaviours start together, end
    together, or can occur at any time within?

    type inference goes down the tree, execution goes up?


    CONFLICT SET: easily done using an adjacency list, just look for nodes
    with no links


    ABT and edges:
    Tree, back, forward, cross edges. Can these be used in nail?

    nodes describing state and edges?

    volition selection for nail behaviour packages.

    goal: flexibility + capability + authoring speed. Not efficiency of algorithms.

    Nail behaviour creation:
    \item pass in astbehaviour
    \item store astbehaviour in correct package
    \item to instantiate extract mods, variables to set flags and create
      symbol table
    \item put prorotypes in list for steps.
    \item return setup?


    cif style volition of behaviours? behaviour entry only?

    superspawn parallel nodes. takes a package of available behaviours,
    spawns appropriate behaviours?

    Add Regex into nail to allow for regex selection of behaviours?



*** Specifications

    Behaviour parameters: priority, specificity, conditions, parent,
    position, effect only, inheritence, wait time?

    Behaviour library: wmes, location, person, event, item

*** Types

    The type system is linked with the behaviour library, using both a
    tree structure of inheritence, and package level access.

    symbol tables and stacks of aliased variables?

    Time as a type, along with wmes and behaviours


*** Working Memory

    belief-revision??

    compile preconditions into a data structure, and use a listener
    pattern to update it. Every time a wme is added, and thus state
    changes, the structure is updated with the new wme in the locations it
    should be.

    alternatively, be able to set listener clauses manually?


    have a bunch of standard internal wmes such as locations, person,
    events, items.

    differentiate between internal origin wmes created by behaviours,
    versus external wmes created via sensors?
    how do i deal with cleaning up the working memory?

    Working memory SHOULD be a hash, and a queue, or ordered by time in
    some way, so that you can specify starting and ending points (to
    facilitate counter factual thinking?)

    have a general template wme, with the ability for the runtime to load
    in additional classes somehow for more specific behaviour?

    make WMEs able to initiate actions or chains of actions/behaviours?

    what would the specific effects of modifying a behaviour have on other
    instances?

    Claiming, strength of claiming, release behaviours? exit actions?


    linear ordering of wmes... possibly on separate lanes for separate
    characters/conceptual constructs?

    So bob does a,b,c,d,e while jill simultaneously does _,f,_,t,_,_,a?



** Logic
   monads and praxis?


   First order logic (maybe exclusion logic?) in the language for wme
   tests and volition tests?


   \exists x, wme(x) $\Rightarrow$ ...
   \forall x, wme(x) $\Rightarrow$ ....

   \exists x, \forall y, wme(x,y) $\Rightarrow$ ...

   \forall x, \exists y, wme(x,y) $\Rightarrow$ ...

   \forall x, \forall y, wme(x,y) $\Rightarrow$ ...


   Where x is a type of wme, and y is a field

** Interpretation Loop
   Text $\Rightarrow$ lexer $\Rightarrow$ parser $\Rightarrow$ runtime $\Rightarrow$ acts $\Rightarrow$ output

   runtime <$\Rightarrow$ working memory

** Nail IDE
   Interface of a text editor, or integrate into emacs. Save, load,
   render tree, start runtime and pass code into it.

   Runtime can be run separately, and instantiated on its own in a
   game. includes parser, main runtime, working memory, decision cycle
   etc.

   Compiler comes later.

   would have 5 windows primarily:
   \item A Tabbed window of wme declarations
   \item Current working memory state
   \item Behaviour declarations in tabs
   \item Instantiated Tree
   \item Compiled tree allowing behaviour navigation


   record incoming wmes, allow to repeat them, disengaged from everything
   else, to allow for test sequences.

   using JSON as a storage format? allows analysing later on?

** ABL

   \item pre

** Design

   a game where your physical movement determines the story. Go down into
   a dark place and the story follows. likewise for light. perfect for
   branching, but im more interested in the authoring effect.

   a game where you are the \emph{trapped} consciousness of someone in
   someone elses body, in a similar way to the end of being john malkovich

   a game that lets you view an emotional journey of a trees life.?

   go to work things seem to start speeding up gradually until you cant
   cope and you need to hide to stay safe.
   or: have the ai be able to understand if something is 'wrong' and
   start to crowd around you.



   rpg's have lacked complex social interaction capabilities instead
   focusing on physical actions. now that social interaction becomes a
   possibility, quest forms need to adapt.

    ``the value of OUTPUT is not a mere trigger like 11-u. instaed all the
    information of the original program lies ``close to the surface'' of
    the output''.

    social acts seem to be similar, containing (noisy) information on how
    to do an action ourselfs.

    to do this in abl, pass context down the tree, add a subtree where two
    agents differ, gives perfect learning. how to make it noisy?
    generalisation? merging subtrees, or removal of bits of subtrees that
    can be designated as S.F.D actions rather than... what? physical
    actions? too broad, physically resultant actions? defined by use
    purpose? discussion of the browad view of use mention applied to
    violin as a fly-swatter. intrinsic properties of the physical
    simulation.

    this doesnt talk of how to add new tests or preconditions to the tree
    to put novel subtrees into...


    farg models share:
    \item thinking is thousands of small independent actions, biased by
      currently activated concepts
    \item activation spreads
    \item there is a mental temperature for amount of randomness
    \item promising avenues are explored more than unpromising ones.
