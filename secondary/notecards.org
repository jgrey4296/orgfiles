    Institutional Entrepreneurs. p7.

    "We likewise see the notions of culture that inform current work
    in these subfields as generally impoverished"

    "The problem is that these elements - collective action, social
    space, culture, organization, the state, and mobilization - which
    are present in all these literatures, have not been integrated
    into any systematic theory in any of the subfields".

    "Much of sociology posits that people are enmeshed in social
    structures that are out of their control and operating at a level
    that is above or outside of them".

    "Everytime we go to work, for instance, we reproduce the part we
    play in the system of labour relations."

    "All are focused on the
    emergence, stabilization/institutionalization, and transformation
    of socially constructed arenas in which embedded actors compete
    for material and status rewards."

    Related Fields:
    1) Social movement studies
    2) organizational theory
    3) economic sociology
    4) historical institutionalism in political science

    "All concerned with how organizations can control and effect change in their environments".

    "Concern with stability and change in field level dynamics is
    central to the work of a number of theorists".

    Fligstein, 96, 01 - Markets as Politics
    Martin, 03 - what is field theory?
    Scott and Meyer, 83 - The organisation of societal sectors.

    The core elements of institutions:
    1) strategic action fields
       2) incumbents, challengers, and governance units
       3) social skill, and existential functions of the social
       4) the broader field environment
       5) exogenous shocks, mobilization and onset of contention
       6) episodes of contention
       7) settlement

    "The rest was just centuries and centuries of people quietly going
    about their daily business - eating, sleeping, having sex,
    endeavoring to be amused - and it occurred to me... that's really
    what history mostly is: masses of people doing ordinary things."

    "Henry Cole, whose other principle claim to history's attention is
    as the inventor of the christmas card (as a way of encouraging
    people to use the new penny post)"

    "In twelve years, eight railway termini opened in London. The
    scale of disruption - the trenches, tunnels, muddy excavations,
    congestion of wagons, the smoke, the din, the clutter.  Meant that
    Victorian London was... the nastiest, foulest, muddiest, busiest,
    most choked and dug over place the world had ever seen."

    "The most popular feature at the great exhibition was not an
    exhibition at all, but rather the elegant 'retiring rooms'"

    "At the British Museum, up to 30,000 daily visitors had to share just two outside privies".

    "The Great Exhibition offered a social breakthrough... for it was
    the first time that people of all classes were brought together
    and allowed to mingle in intimate proximity."

    Three Basic Research Questions:
    1) How will a change in agent structure affect behaviour?
       (Given a task and environment)
    2) How will a change in agent task affect behaviour?
       (Given a particular environment)
    3) How will a change in environment affect an agent's
       behaviour on a task?

    Not mentioned:
    1) How will a change in {Behaviour/Task/Environment} affect structure?
    2) How will achange in structure affect the {environment/task}?

    The virtues of theories in ill-defined behaviour. P379

    Clancey's descriptions of 'heuristic classification' did not use a
    precise definition, but with lots of examples.

    "Its a waste of time to argue about a definition unless changing
    it has ramifications".

    Systems like X in three ways:
    1) Listing systems with similar behaviours
    2) Feature Characterization - subcomponents
    3) Causal explanation - how features interact to produce behaviours

    Generalization Strategy:
    1) Find examples of behaviour of interest
    2) Find out what the cases have in common
    3) Build a causal explanation around the common features.

    P3: "AI Systems are simple compared with human cognition, their tasks
    are rudimentary; and compared with everyday physical environments,
    those in which our programs operate are extremely reduced.
    Yet many are in many ways like chemical, biological, mechanical, and psychological processes."
