** Computational Social Science Thoughts
*** Musings on Jurafsky et al's computational politeness

    Praxis deals with social transgressions through explicitly authored
    actions.  This is somewhat ill suited to my general task of replacing
    as much authoring as possible with a generative approach.

    Jurafsky talks about politeness being a central force in communication
    'as basic a pressure as to be truthful, informative, relevant, and
    clear'. This is a far nobler view of communication than I wish to
    model. I agree that language provides numerous and diverse means for
    encoding politeness in conversation.

    I want to be able to vary the level of encoding of politeness, truth,
    information, relevance, and clarity. What else could be varied, and
    should be varied?

    If we can define politeness markers, identify their position in speech
    acts such that they act as markers, *and* can identify their
    correlation with higher level concepts such as power, *and* such
    relatively easily defined terms that comprise power, such as social
    status, authority and autonomy, then why are we not using it to
    structure and procedurally generate agents, enabling them to have a
    rudimentary economy, and then playing with the knobs?

    Computational Social Science seems to have a broad number of means of
    modeling a reasonable number of different social structures (ie: see
    Axtell's Sugarscape that seems to have evolved a ton of
    behaviours). We should be able to combine such behaviours, and pair
    them with at least rudimentary speech acts surely?

*** Walker et al. Improvising linguisting style: social and affective bases for agent personality.

    This may be the starting point, coupled with a set of cultural rules,
    a vocabulary and linguistic styling of walker, could then feed up to
    personal agents emotional status. This can interact with their
    institutional authority.

    Thus: 1) Cultural rules: always be polite to little old
    men. Politeness consists of: marking + following their
    requests. Honourifics: Sir, Madam, etc...
    2) Polite Markings: Please {Honourific}. etc.
    3) Basic Speech Acts to decorate.
    4) institutional acts to perform, as verbs of
       combinations of sequences of behaviours?

*** The Dark Souls Base Game
**** The Physical System
***** Combat - Physical attacks
      The combat is a large amount of complexity. Light, Heavy, Two Handed
      attacks, kicking, blocking, Weapons, items, and armour all provide changes
      to the events that can, and do, occur.
***** Movement
      The speed of movement is based upon, essentially, what a player is wearing.
***** Conversation with specific individuals
      Linear sequences of individual meetings, with specified binary response
      points, and triggered by particular actions in the larger game world. Can
      enable purchasing, and simple quests.
***** Purchase of Items and Spells
      Spells fall into a couple of particular categories (Sourcery, Pyromancer,
      Dark, Light) which can also have meaning related to affiliation and likely
      actions
***** Bloodstains and Ghosts
      Provide short inaccurate histories of player deaths, a visual record of
      someones actions.
***** Fog Doors
      Hint at major location transitions, and Bosses, but it can be hard to know
      which
***** Bonfires
      Hub points for individuals to gather to some extent
***** Physical Objects
***** Enemies

**** NPCs
     There is the despondent knight, the cleric, etc. People to talk to you can
     buy items from, or summon them during fights, and who provide information.
***** [[http://darksouls.wikidot.com/solaire-of-astora][Solaire]]
      As a recurring, iconic individual, Solaire grabs attention, and 'Praise the
      Sun' has become a favourite. It has *meaning* and ties people together.

      Siegmeyer is another iconic character, remaining ironic as you progress
      past him constantly, while he is always friendly.
*** [[http://darksouls.wikia.com/wiki/Covenant][Dark Souls Covenants]]
    The covenants provide an institution in isolation. The actions of the base
    game limit what can be done, while the covenant collects behaviours, meaning,
    and messages to interact with others. The covenants are essentially the
    institution, abstracted from the organization. They provide a set of base
    concepts, and idealised behaviours, without there being a formal organisation
    with actions, tasks etc. There are no relations between members of the
    covenants in most situations.
**** Warriors of Sunlight

*** Communication with NPCs and Others
    Communication falls into Scripted text sequences between the player and NPCs,
    and limited grammar messages between players.
**** Custom Language Sequences
     NPCs can have limited amounts of customised language, fully english.
**** [[http://darksouls.wikia.com/wiki/Messages][Dark Souls Grammar]]
     Messages meanwhile are limited to a limited grammar, providing sequences of
     simple symbols.
**** Surroundings + Symbols + Meaning -> Message
     You see an impressive (meaning) sight (surrounding), and leave a message to
     communicate that with others.

     You get killed by an enemy (surrounding) that you hadn't noticed initially
     (concept: ambush), and leave a message to warn others.

     You read a message of symbols which provides you a direction to praise the
     sun.

     (Note: the surrounding, and grammar are very strictly defined) Can this be
     represented as a simple algebra? meaning + surrounding + symbols -> message
     So: message - surrounding -> symbols + meaning all the while holding the
     following constant: message - surrounding - meaning - > symbols

     But what is important about this is that language is powerful enough to
     allow repeated uses to perform: message - grammar - meaning -> surrounding
     and: message - surrounding - symbols -> meaning


     If we make up a type system for this: Meaning :: Grammar Surrounding ::
     Grammar Symbols :: Grammar AgentState :: (Meaning, Surrounding) Message ::
     AgentState -> Meaning -> Surrounding -> Symbols -> AgentState

     A Message is an operation of an agent, with limited grammars for thinking,
     observing, and manipulating the world, which triggers a state change in some
     other agent.

     The above describes a base functional system that lacks institutions. The
     effect of institutions on those formulae could be: Institution :: Rules ->
     Institution Institution(M) :: message -> Institution -> Institution(Message)

     Ie: An Institution is a co-monad. It holds contextual information, which can
     then be bound with an actual message, to encode effects.

     So, an institution can provide coherence between messages more complex than
     the message on its own can handle.

*** Conclusion
    In conclusion, I have shown how underdeveloped the systems in videogames are regarding institutions.
    Literature on Institutions, as structured collections of norms, glosses over structural and mechanical descriptions of,
    in all but the most trivial of cases.
    Those computational systems that have approached simulation of institutions (CiF and Versu in particular),
    have only supported authored situations, lacking the ability to vary and generate institutions themselves.
    By describing the structural and procedural components of existing historical institutions, it is clear that the
    rational coherence of institutions are typically overstated.
    I have implemented, inspired by current Nor-MAS systems, a variety of social institutions, and varied them procedurally.
** On Inserting Ritual structure into social interactions                       :socialInteractions:ritual:
*** The Question
    Can a ritualistic or tribal society be
    procedurally generated over the top of CiF
    and/or Praxis?

*** Clarification

    Tribal Societies defined as group structures,
    that provide a number of:
    a) transformative representations of a society's
    reality (ie: war parties => dancing)
    b) Consequential, irremedial, irrevocable acts
    c) a Stake in the proceedings
    d) status change
    e) use of space
    f) marking of time
    g) display / reaffirmation of relation
    h) power structure / authority
    i) hygene, courtesy, norms,
    j) information transfer / indoctrination
    h) social action
    i) signaling modification of a different rule

*** The Conclusion

**** Introduction:
     If we characterise the scope of systems surrounding an individual in the way of Bronfenbrenner:
     a) Individual
     b) Microsystem
     c) Meso System
     d) ExoSystem
     e) MacroSystem

     Then I am proposing a system that, leveraging the interpersonal
     capabilities of CiF and Praxis, enables actions on a dynamic higher
     system. Actions that, due to the authorizations and culture of a
     society, have a greater impact that on just the relationship with the
     other person, while that interpersonal aspect remains a factor.

     This has a broad structure of:
     Individual -> Speech Acts -> Social Fields Changes -> Individual Behaviour Changes

     A Core component of this is Gidden's discussion of routinization,
     regularization, and time.

       responses to that,

       A Raptor piloted by Racetrack experiences engine failure soon after launch and collides with Colonial One, nearly killing President Roslin and her aide Tory Foster. An investigation reveals that a recent batch of Tylium fuel contains impurities and Roslin calls upon Xeno Fenner, the director of the fleet's refinery ship, for answers. When Fenner meets Roslin and Admiral Adama, he is sarcastic and uncooperative, calling the situation a "glitch." He admits that it may be his workers' way of getting some attention after repeatedly being ignored regarding the squalid and dangerous conditions they face every day without a single break. Roslin doesn't sympathize, explaining that fuel production is critical and must be maintained. When Fenner quotes text from an underground book by Gaius Baltar, "If you hear the people, you never have to fear the people" and threatens a few more "glitches," Roslin has him arrested.

       Adama is stunned by her action and inquires about the book. Visibly angered, Roslin whispers that Gaius Baltar's attorney has passed a manuscript around the fleet written by Baltar entitled, My Triumphs, My Mistakes. It deals with class struggle, and she says she is thinking about having a "good ol' fashioned book burning." Adama contacts Chief Tyrol, informs him of Fenner's arrest, and orders him to go to the refinery ship to take charge of the situation. Tyrol's wife Cally admits to Tyrol that she has read Baltar's book, which discusses the unfair labor differences between the people of the Twelve Colonies. She questions why the people from the poorer colonies like Gemenon, Sagittaron, and Aerelon are forced to work in harsh blue-collar jobs while the more elite and educated colonials from places like Caprica, Tauron and Virgon get to keep their plush white-collar jobs.

       Roslin goes to Baltar's cell and demands that he hand over the pages from his book. She lies, saying it was intercepted before anyone could read it, and orders the guards to tear the room apart. She concludes with a partial strip search of Baltar during which Six appears in Baltar's mind and tells him to protect his dignity. Six slides her hand into his open pants, but Baltar stops her. He withdraws the pages of his book and surrenders them to Roslin, who sneers that she's been "dying to see how it ends" and mocks his attempt to appear as a "man of the people."

       Meanwhile, Tyrol arrives on the refinery ship and takes a tour of the facility, led by a foreman named Cavett. He witnesses the somber glances from the tired, grime-covered workers who are both men and women ranging in age from the elderly to mere children. Tyrol goes to the massive Tylium storage room where a single, dwindling pile of ore remains. Cavett says they're lucky if the supply lasts long enough to get them out of the system. Next, Tyrol goes to the main conveyor line where the work has completely shut down. Tyrol asks for a reason for the shutdown, but the workers remain silently defiant until a young boy named Milo speaks up and says the pressure seals are broken. Tyrol notices that the seals are completely missing and have been removed by the workers in protest of Fenner's arrest.

       Tyrol returns to Galactica and informs Roslin and Adama of the missing seals and explains the workers are buying time for their pleas to be heard. He adds that some of the workers have been doing the same grueling job since the attack on the Colonies and requests Roslin accede to some of their demands for a break. Roslin objects, however, saying it is just as difficult to work aboard the algae processing, recycling and waste handling ships. She sees their work stoppage as extortion and demands the names of the organizers. Tyrol hesitantly surrenders Cavett's name.

       Cavett is arrested and joins Fenner in an adjacent cell. When Tyrol visits them, he finds that Cavett is having a breakdown and injuring himself. Fenner reminds Tyrol that Cavett was tortured by the Cylons back on New Caprica, and confinement is causing him post-traumatic stress. Tyrol tells Fenner there is no time for games and demands Cavett reveal where the seals have been hidden. Fenner hesitates, then angrily reveals that they were hidden in the air vents. Tyrol then has the men released and work is resumed aboard the refinery ship.

       Later, Tyrol goes to Colonial One to talk to Roslin. He explains parents are passing down their skills to their children, and they are forever stuck doing the same job in the next generation. He says they should be given a chance to choose their future. Roslin understands the problem and tells him to make a list of colonists with relevant skills to supplement those aboard the labor ships. Next, Tyrol deals with a protesting young man named Danny Noon who was pulled from Dogsville. Noon had worked a summer job on a farm to earn money for college, but agriculture is not his career choice. Tyrol tells him the job is only temporary and has the angry youth escorted away.

       Tyrol then finds a copy of Baltar's book and opens to a page entitled The Emerging Aristocracy and the Emerging Underclass. Tyrol goes to Baltar's cell and refers to the book. Baltar learns the truth that the book has been leaked and asks Tyrol what he thinks about it. Tyrol responds that he thinks it's a load of crap, disbelieving Baltar's claim that he grew up on a farm on Aerelon - especially since Baltar's accent is different from other Aerelons he knows. Baltar, speaking in an Aerelon accent, states that he learned to mimic the Caprican accent to help hide the fact he was from Aerelon, a poor farming world known as the "food basket for the twelve worlds." Baltar explains the purpose of the book was to show that class-strife has continued to follow the fleet well after the Cylon attack, and they will find that those in the aristocracy will continue to hold onto their power.

       Tyrol returns to the refinery ship where work halts when the conveyor system becomes jammed. Fenner says the belt must be repaired or else a back-up will occur which could cause the "hot" Tylium further down the line to go critical and cause a chain reaction that will take out the whole ship. Without stopping the slipping belt, Tyrol finds the problem is a jammed drive mechanism, but he is unable to reach it. Danny Noon frees the jam but injures his arm in the processes. Fed up, Tyrol walks to main control levers and shuts down the entire factory. He declares the workers to be on strike.

       Aboard Galactica, Starbuck finds her flight mission delayed by hangar workers who are playing cards on a Raptor wing. She demands they get back to work where the senior deckhand, Pollux, tells her that they are only servicing vital missions per orders from Chief Tyrol. Tyrol is immediately arrested. Admiral Adama angrily confronts Tyrol in the brig and orders him to call off the work stoppage, but Tyrol refuses. Adama says he will not tolerate the disobedience of orders, calling it mutiny and reminding him that mutineers are shot, but Tyrol stays put. Adama grabs the phone and orders the arrest of Cally. Alarmed, Tyrol asks what he's doing. To get his point across, Adama says he will execute Cally as mutineer and continue with the rebellious deck crew if he has to. He admits it's something he doesn't want to do, but will to maintain the survival of the fleet. Tyrol relents and calls off the strike. Adama tells him to report to Roslin who wishes to discuss the labor situation.

       Tyrol meets with Roslin on Colonial One and they talk about the cultural vocations that some colonists are locked into by birth. Tyrol suggests setting up a training program to allow the colonists to learn more than one trade, and a work rotation started so that those in dangerous and dirty jobs get an equal chance to work in more comfortable and safer positions in the fleet. He adds that he'd like to see some of Colonial One's crew get their hands dirty for a change. Roslin agrees, but tells Tyrol to consider the reestablishment of the worker's union that he led back on New Caprica as it will ensure stability within the fleet.

       Later, Tyrol calls his deck crew to muster when Starbuck arrives and demands to know why Seelix is 20 minutes late for her first day of pilot training. Seelix is confused and Tyrol apologizes, explaining that Seelix has been promoted to Ensign and assigned to flight training - something she was turned down for earlier because her job as an avionics specialist was too important. Tyrol pins the Ensign rank on her collar and salutes her while Starbuck tells the newly recruited nugget to double-time it to debriefing. Seelix rushes off with an excited smile on her face.



***** House of Cards

      Frank helped ensure the election of President Garrett Walker, who
      promised to appoint Frank as Secretary of State.

      However, before Walker is sworn in, Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez
      announces that Walker will not honor the agreement and will instead
      nominate Senator Michael Kern.

      Linda tells Frank that they want him to continue helping their
      administration from within the House of Representatives, starting with
      working on an education reform bill with Representative Donald Blythe.

      Furious at Walker's betrayal, Frank and his wife Claire, an
      environmental activist, make a pact to destroy Walker, starting with
      Kern.

      Frank starts seeking out pawns in his war against Walker.

      When the troubled Representative Peter Russo is arrested for drunk
      driving, Frank offers him a reprieve in exchange for his loyalty,
      covering up the incident by bribing the commissioner with funds for
      his political ambitions.

      Frank also encounters Zoe Barnes, a young political reporter for the
      Washington Herald newspaper.

      The two come to an agreement where Frank will give Zoe inside
      information that will further Zoe's own stagnating career, and giving
      Frank a patsy to serve incriminating information to destroy his
      opponents.

      He starts by leaking a copy of the first draft of Donald's education
      bill that proposes massive increases in government control of
      education, promptly causing a scandal one day after the inauguration.

      In the aftermath of the leak of the education bill draft, Frank
      manages to secure full control of the legislative course from the
      president and promptly removes Donald, who graciously takes the fall
      for the controversy in the press for Frank's sake.

      Claire fires over half of her NGO's staff to secure the necessary
      level of funds for her own plans for the organization.

      With Zoe's help, Frank plants a story that loosely ties Kern to an
      anti-Israel editorial that ran in the college newspaper he edited.

      Kern gravely mishandles the resulting media questions, throwing doubt
      on his candidacy.

      Frank then forces Russo to travel to meet a conspiracy junkie who
      used to be on the college newspaper and encourages him to state that
      Kern wrote the article himself, and the resulting firestorm of
      controversy destroys Kern's chances.

      Frank then tosses Catherine Durant's name to Zoe as the likely
      replacement before reinforcing her credentials to Vasquez.



      Frank is forced to return to his hometown of Gaffney, South Carolina
      in the midst of negotiating the education bill's reforms to the
      teachers' unions when his main rival stirs trouble.

      A young woman has been killed in a car accident after texting while
      driving, apparently distracted by a peach water tower that Frank has
      advocated to keep standing.

      His rival encourages the parents to sue, forcing Frank into a
      difficult negotiation.



      Frank resorts to intricate political string-pulling when House Speaker
      Bob Birch refuses to support putting the education bill through the
      house with its controversial amendments.

      As a result, Frank organizes a coup that forces the majority leader
      to step down in place of one that Frank wants, in order to put
      pressure on Birch to cooperate and keep his Speakership.

      Frank forces Russo to allow a shipyard in his district to close to
      keep a military base in his new majority leader Terry Womack's
      district open, ensuring his support for a coup if necessary.

      Tom is exasperated at Zoe's rebelliousness but the Herald's publisher
      overrules him.

      Tom offers Zoe the post of White House correspondent but she has
      doubts and is ultimately drawn closer to Frank.

      Remy re-tables an offer to the CWI but Claire refuses it at Frank's
      urging.

      Claire meets with photographer Adam Galloway, a former lover who
      tries to rekindle their relationship.


      The changes to the education bill lead to a frosty meeting between
      Frank and the head lobbyist for the teachers' union, who proves
      himself a dangerous adversary.

      The fallout from being forced to close the shipyard along with
      thousands of jobs for his constituents by Frank, along with the
      departure of Christina, sends Peter Russo into depression.

      Frank and Claire foil the lobbyist's attempt to disrupt their
      fundraising plans.

      In retaliation, the lobbyist calls for a nationwide strike.



      As the teachers' strike escalates and the president quickly loses
      support due to it extending over three weeks, Frank is pressured to
      drop the bill entirely.

      He now has to achieve total victory to get the bill through and end
      the strike on his terms.

      A brick through Frank's window allows him to target the architect of
      the strike, lobbyist Marty Spinella, and the pair go head-to-head on
      TV in a confrontation that ends up embarrassing Frank further, and
      Frank is barely able to keep the president from forcing him to cut
      the bill.

      A cleaned-up Russo confides his intention to run for Governor of
      Pennsylvania; Frank sets the wheels in motion by enlisting Claire's
      help to draft a mutually beneficial environmental bill.

      A night spent scanning the police frequencies pays off when a local
      tragedy deals Frank a winning card, forcing Spinella to confront him.

      He goads Spinella into a rage, revealing he organized the brick
      incident himself, resulting in Spinella assaulting him when no one
      else is in the room.

      This gives Frank the leverage he needs: end the strike now, or Frank
      will press charges and send Spinella to jail.



      President Walker finally signs the education bill into law, earning
      Frank a major victory by affording him great influence and favor with
      Walker.

      Vice President Matthews is feeling sidelined and expresses discontent
      with Walker.

      Peter Russo readies himself for the governor's race ahead by
      attending AA meetings while his campaign team discusses strategies.

      Frank uses his relationship with Zoe to generate some positive spin
      on the announcement and taps Christina for the position of deputy
      campaign manager.

      Zoe recommends Janine Skorsky for a job.



      Along with Claire, Frank visits his alma mater at his military
      college, which is honoring him by naming a new library after him.

      He spends the night reminiscing and drinking with old friends,
      including one who may have been his former boyfriend, allowing a
      glimpse behind Frank's mask.

      Among the guests of the event is Remy Danton, who advises that
      SanCorp has concerns about Peter Russo running for governor.

      In the meantime, Peter returns to Philadelphia and visits his mother.

      He then tries to convince former shipyard employees to support him;
      an angry meeting with them reveals an uphill struggle ahead but he
      remains undeterred.



      Peter goes on a bus tour around Pennsylvania with Vice-President
      Matthews.

      Matthews initially torpedoes Peter's campaign but is eventually won
      over.

      Frank tries to whip support in Congress for the Delaware River bill.

      He needs Claire's help, but she is disappointed about how little help
      she is receiving for her own projects and goes behind Frank's back to
      ensure that the bill fails.

      Zoe decides her relationship with Frank should be purely professional
      but changes her mind when he stonewalls her.



      Frank is upset with Claire regarding the bill's failure, and Claire
      storms out.

      She approaches Zoe and informs her that the affair with her husband
      is not a secret.

      She then goes away to meet her own lover Adam, not telling Frank
      where she is.

      Frank is losing control of Russo and Zoe, who are turning on Frank
      for their own ends.

      He needs to keep Russo in line and also find out his wife's
      whereabouts.

      Russo slips in his sobriety and gets drunk with Rachel (the
      prostitute he was initially caught with in the premiere), falling
      into the trap Frank is setting for him.

      A drunk Russo makes a mess of a phone interview which Frank plans to
      use to crush his chances for governor and make his next move.



      After Russo's disastrous phone interview, Frank convinces Matthews to
      run for Governor in Russo's place.

      Vasquez asks Frank forthrightly if he is ambitious to be Vice
      President himself and, after some reticence, he admits that this was
      his plan all along and reaches out to her as an ally.

      Meanwhile, after attempting to reconnect with his children, a
      still-inebriated Russo hands himself in to the police.

      Frank picks him up from jail and, recognizing him to be too much of a
      liability, proceeds to kill Russo through Carbon monoxide poisoning,
      making it look like a suicide.



      With Matthews about to win the governor's race, Frank is helping the
      White House vet VP candidates.

      The President suddenly sends him to evaluate Raymond Tusk, a
      multi-billionaire who lives modestly in St.

      Louis.

      But after staying with him, Frank eventually discovers deeper
      connections between Tusk and the President and learns that he is the
      one being vetted.

      Tusk offers to support him in return for an unspecified favor — but
      Frank refuses.

      Meanwhile Janine and Zoe's persistence starts to pay off as they
      begin to see through the conspiracy regarding Frank and Russo.


      Frank meets again with Tusk and reaches an accommodation; the
      President offers him the VP post and he accepts.

      Claire consults a doctor about possible fertility treatments.

      She also fires Gillian, who then sues her for wrongful termination
      and refuses any settlement.

      Meanwhile, Zoe, Lucas, and Janine learn Rachel's identity and begin
      to put together more of the pieces of Frank's plots.




***** Stanislaw Lem
****** Trurl and Klapaucius

       Trurl and Klapaucius are brilliant (robotic) engineers, called
       "constructors" (because they can construct practically anything at
       will), capable of almost God-like exploits.

       For instance, on one occasion Trurl creates an entity capable of
       extracting accurate information from the random motion of gas
       particles, which he calls a "Demon of the Second Kind".

       He describes the "Demon of the First Kind" as a Maxwell's demon.

       On another, the two constructors re-arrange stars near their home
       planet in order to advertise.

       The duo are best friends and rivals.

       When they are not busy constructing revolutionary mechanisms at home,
       they travel the universe, aiding those in need.

       As the characters are firmly established as good and righteous, they
       take no shame in accepting handsome rewards for their services.

       If rewards were promised and not delivered, the constructors may even
       severely punish those who deceived them.

****** The world and its inhabitants

       The universe of The Cyberiad is pseudo-Medieval.

       There are kingdoms, knights, princesses, and even dragons in
       abundance.

       Robots are usually anthropomorphic, to the point of being divided
       into sexes.

       Love and marriage are possible.

       Physical and mental disabilities, old age and death, particularly in
       case of accidents or murder, are also common, though mechanical
       language is used to describe them.

       Death is theoretically avoidable (by means of repair), and sometimes
       even reversible.



       In fact, the teacher of Trurl and Klapaucius, Master Cerebron, is
       deceased, but can still be reanimated at his tomb.

       The level of technology of the vast majority of inhabitants is
       pseudo-Medieval also, with swords, robotic steeds, and gallows
       widespread.

       With this co-exist space travel, extremely advanced technology made
       by the Constructors and futuristic weapons and devices used or
       mentioned on occasion.

       There even exists a civilization that has achieved the "HPLD" –
       Highest Possible Level of Development.

****** Romantic stories

       Some stories are basically self-conscious parodies of romantic novels
       about knights, with more profound issues of psychology and social
       dynamics under a cartoonish and swashbuckling facade.

       A typical example is the fairy tale O królewiczu Ferrycym i królewnie
       Krystali) ("Prince Ferrix and the Princess Crystal").

       A princely (robotic) knight falls in love with a beautiful (robotic)
       princess.

       Unfortunately, the princess is somewhat eccentric, and is captivated
       by stories of an alien non-robotic, "paleface" civilization (the
       humans).

       She declares that she will only marry a "paleface".

       Therefore, the knight decides to masquerade as a paleface.

       He covers himself with mud, starting to resemble one, and then comes
       to woo her.



       Meanwhile, a real "paleface" captive arrives, given as a gift to the
       king.

       It immediately becomes obvious to the princess who is the "muddier"
       one, but the "paleface" turns out to be too squishy and overall
       disgusting.

       Not wanting to back down at the last minute, however, the princess
       declares a joust between the two suitors to select the worthier one.

       When the "paleface" charges at the robot, he splatters himself on the
       latter's metal chest, revealing the metallic body to all.

       The princess, beholding the beauty of the exposed robot (compared
       with the ugliness of the "paleface"), changes her mind.

       The knight and the princess live happily ever after.

****** Stories involving technology and the Constructors

       Most of the stories involve Trurl and Klapaucius using their
       extraordinary technological abilities to help the inhabitants of the
       medieval planets, usually involving neutralizing tyrants.

       For example:

       Trurl and Klapaucius come to a planet ruled by a king who loves
       hunting.

       He has already "conquered" all the most dangerous of predators, and
       now hires constructors (engineers) to make new, mighty robotic beasts
       for him to hunt.

       He has already executed all of the previous constructors who visited
       because they could not build beasts that would be challenging enough
       to hunt.

       When the two famous Constructors arrive, they are arrested and
       ordered to construct a worthy foe for the king within twelve days.



       The two face a dilemma: if they make something that the king will
       kill, they will be executed by the mad king.

       But if the king himself is killed, then they will be executed, for
       the next king will be pressured to show his respect for the previous.

       They solve the problem by building an animal that survives the hunt
       (involving both cyber-hounds and nuclear tipped missiles unleashed
       upon it, in the characteristic cartoonish manner) and takes the king
       hostage by, nothing less, turning into several police officers and
       presenting an order for his arrest.

       All the king's men fail to find and free the king (partially because
       in searching for the fake policemen one half of the real police force
       arrests the other half), and he is released only after the
       Constructors' numerous demands are met.



       On another occasion, Trurl and Klapaucius are captured by an
       interstellar "PHT" pirate.

       Trurl offers to build a machine capable of turning hydrogen into gold
       (something he can do manually, which he demonstrates by hand, mixing
       up protons and putting electrons around).

       However, the pirate turns out to have a PhD and cares not for the
       riches, but for knowledge (and in fact points out that gold becomes
       cheap if it is abundant).

       Trurl therefore makes a modified Maxwell's demon for him, an entity
       that looks at moving particles of gas and reads information that is,
       coincidentally, encoded in their random perturbations.

       This way, all the information in the universe becomes easily
       available.

       The demon prints out this information on a long paper tape, but
       before the pirate realizes most of the information is completely
       useless (although strictly factual) he is buried under the endless
       rolls of tape, ceasing to bother anyone.

****** Stories involving the search for happiness and ideal society

       The Highest Possible Level of Development civilization.

       A gravely injured hermit comes to Trurl's house and tells Trurl of
       Klapaucius's adventure: Klapaucius wanders across an old robot, who
       tells him that he has logically deduced the existence of a
       civilization that reached the highest possible level of development
       (hence "HPLD").

       He has inferred the existence of such a civilization by figuring that
       if there are different stages of development, there will be one that
       is the highest.

       He was then faced with a problem of identifying that one; as he
       noted, everyone claimed that theirs was the HPLD.

       Upon much research and thought, he decided that the only way to find
       it is by looking for a "wonder", i.e.  something that has no rational explanation.

       Eventually Klapaucius discovers one such wonder: a star in the shape
       of a cube, orbited by a planet also shaped like a cube with the huge
       letters HPLD written on it.

       He lands and meets its inhabitants: a group of about 100 individuals
       lying around doing nothing.

       When the HPLDs grow tired with Klapaucius's efforts to extract
       answers from them, they teleport him and his ship far into outer
       space, albeit after filling the ship with gifts.


       Seeing how he will not get anywhere this way, Klapaucius constructs a
       massive machine capable of simulating the entire universe, including a
       member of the HPLD civilization.

       Upon questioning the simulation, he is informed that over six million
       such interrogations took place in the past.

       The simulation also reveals that the civilization in question has
       long since achieved the HPLD, and thus has nothing else to strive
       for.



       When Klapaucius asks why the HPLD civilization does not continuously
       engage in helping other, less advanced civilizations, the simulation
       explains that their attempts to do so in the past have proven
       extremely counter-productive.

       For instance, having dropped some millions of wish-fulfilling devices
       on a planet, they saw it blow up in a matter of hours.

       Eventually, the HPLD representative provides Klapaucius with the
       formula for "Altruizine" – a substance that allows individuals within
       a limited area to completely share all feelings and emotions,
       including both pain and joy.

       The idea behind Altruizine is that people who feel each other's pain
       as their own should treat each other as they would themselves.


****** Altruizine.

       Klapaucius produces a large quantity of the substance and sends the
       above mentioned hermit (who is eager to help others) in human guise
       to experiment on the population of a single planet.

       Some of the results include villagers feeling the birth pains of a
       cow, depressed people being violently attacked and driven off and a
       crowd storming the house of the newlyweds to vicariously participate
       in their unaccustomed sensations.

       Eventually, the hermit is identified for a robot (because he does not
       feel the humans' pain), is thoroughly beaten and tortured, then shot
       into outer space via a cannon.

       He then lands near Trurl's house, where the story began.

       Concluding his tale, the hermit assures Trurl that his thirst for
       altruism has vanished.


****** Trurl and the construction of happy worlds.

       Trurl is not deterred by the cautionary tale of altruizine and
       decides to build a race of robots happy by design.

       His first attempt are a culture of robots who are not capable of
       being unhappy (e.g. they are happy if seriously beaten up).

       Klapaucius ridicules this.

       Next step is a collectivistic culture dedicated to common happiness.

       When Trurl and Klapaucius visit them, they are drafted by the
       Ministry of Felicity and made to smile, sing, and otherwise be happy,
       in fixed ranks (with other inhabitants).



       Trurl annihilates both failed cultures and tries to build a perfect
       society in a small box.

       The inhabitants of the box develop a religion saying that their box
       is the most perfect part of the universe and prepare to make a hole
       in it in order to bring everyone outside the Box into its perfection,
       by force if needed.

       Trurl disposes of them and decides that he needs more variety in his
       experiments and smaller scale for safety.



       He creates hundreds of miniature worlds on microscope slides (i.e. he
       has to observe them through a microscope).

       These microworlds progress rapidly, some dying out in revolutions and
       wars, and some developing as regular civilizations without any of
       them showing any intrinsic perfection or happiness.

       They do achieve inter-slide travel though, and many of these worlds
       are later destroyed by rats.



       Eventually, Trurl gets tired of all the work and builds a computer
       that will contain a programmatic clone of his mind that would do the
       research for him.

       Instead of building new worlds, the computer sets about expanding
       itself.

       When Trurl eventually forces it to stop building itself and start
       working, the clone-Trurl tells him that he has already created lots
       of sub-Trurl programs to do the work and tells him stories about
       their research (which Trurl later finds out is bogus).

       Trurl destroys the computer and temporarily stops looking for
       universal happiness.

***** Eric and Writing
      It was around noon. In the jungle behind Rincewind creatures whooped and gibbered. Mosquitoes the size of humming-birds whined around his head.
      "Of course," he said, for the tenth time, "They've never really got around to inventing paper."
      The stonemason stood bake, handed the latest blunted obsidian chisel to his assistant, and gave Rincewind and expectant look.
      Rincewind stood back and examined the rock critically.
      "It's very good," he said. "I mean, it's a very good likeness. You've got his hairstyle and everything. Of course, he's not as, er, square as that normally but, yes, very good. And here's the chariot and there's the step-pyramids. Yes. Well, it looks as though they want you to go to the city with them," he said to Eric.
      "Tell them yes," said Eric firmly.
      Rincewind turned to the headman.
      "Yes," he said.
      "¿[Hunched-figure-in-triple-feathered-headdress-over-three-dots]?"
      Rincewind sighed. Without saying a word, the stonemason put a fresh stone chisel into his unresisting fingers and manhandled a new slab of granite into position.
      One of the problems of being a Tezuman, apart from having a god like Quezovercoatl, is that if you unexpectedly need to order an extra pint of milk tomorrow you should have started writing the note last month. Tezumen are the only people who beat themselves to death with their own suicide notes.

***** Eric and wossnames
      Rincewind felt something claw its way up his back and onto his shoulder, where a voice like a sheet of metal being torn in half said, "That's better. Very wossname, comfy. If you try and knock me off, demon, you can wossname your ear goodbye. What a turn up for the scrolls, eh? They seemed to be expecting him."
      "Why do you keep saying wossname?" said Rincewind.
      "Limited wossname. Doodah. Thingy. You know. It's got words in it," said the parrot.
      "Dictionary?" said Rincewind. They passengers in the other chariots had got out and were also groveling to Eric, who was beaming like an idiot.
      The parrot considered this.

***** Eric and Tribe
      Rincewind stared at the blocks nearest the statue. It had taken the
      Tezumen two storeys, twenty years and ten thousand tons of granite to
      explain what they intended to do to the Ruler of the World, but the
      result was, well, graphic. He would be left in no doubt that they were
      annoyed. He might even go so far as to deduce that they were quite
      vexed.  "But why do they give him all these jewels to start with?" he
      said, pointing.  "Well, he is the Ruler," said da Quirm. "He's
      entitled to some respect, I suppose."  Rincewind nodded. There was a
      sort of justice in it. If you were a tribe who lived in a swamp in the
      middle of a damp forest, didn't have any metal, had been saddled with
      a god like Quezovercoatl, and then found someone who said he was in
      charge of the whole affair, you probably would want to spend some time
      explaining to him how incredibly disappointed in him you were. The
      Tezumen had never seen any reason to be subtle in dealing with
      deities.

***** Eric and The Tezumen
      "Chin up, lad," said da Quirm. "At least you're being sacrificed for something worthwhile. I just suggested they tried using the wheels upright, so they'd roll. I'm afraid they're not very responsive to new ideas around here. Still, nil desperandum. Where there's life there's hope."
      Rincewind growled. If there was one thing he couldn't stand, it was people who were fearless in the face of death. It seemed to strike at something absolutely fundamental in him.
      "In fact," said da Quirm, "I think -" He rolled from side to side experimentally, tugging at the vines which were holding him down. "Yes, I think when they did these ropes up - yes, definitely, they -"
      "What? What?" said Rincewind.
      "Yes, definitely," said da Quirm. "I'm absolutely sure about it. They did them up very tightly and professionally. Not an inch of give in them anywhere."
      "Thank you," said Rincewind.
      The flat top of the truncated pyramid was in fact quite large, with plenty of room for statues, priests, slabs, gutters, knife-chipping production lines and all the other things the Tezumen needed for the bulk disposal of religion. In front of Rincewind several priests were busily chanting a long list of complaints about swamps, mosquitoes, lack of metal ore, volcanoes, the weather, the way obsidian never kept it's edge, the trouble with having a god like Quezovercoatl, the way wheels never worked properly however often you laid them flat and pushed them, and so on.
      The prayers of most religions generally praise and thank the gods involved, either out of general piety or in the hope that he or she will take the hint and start acting responsibly. The Tezumen, having taken a long hard look around their world and decided bluntly that things were just about as bad as they were ever going to get, had perfected the art of the plain-chant winge.
      "Won't be long now," said the parrot, from its perch atop a statue of one of the Tezumen's lesser gods.

***** Eric and Demons
      Rincewind ignored it and crept over to the window. It was small, but gave out on to a gently sloping roof. And out there was a real life, real sky, real buildings. He reached out to open the shutters -
      A crackling current coursed up his arm and earthed itself in his cerebellum.
      He sat on the floor, sucking his fingers.
      "He tole you," said the parrot, swinging backwards and forwards upside down. "But you wouldn't wossname. He's got you by the wossnames."
      "But it should only work on demons!"
      "Ah," said the parrot, achieving enough momentum to swing upright again, whereupon it steadied itself with the stubby remains of what had once been wings. "It's all according, isn't it. If you come in the door marked `wossnames` that means you get treated as a wossname, right? Demon, I mean. Subject to all the rules and wossnames. Tough one for you."
      "But you know I'm a wizard, don't you!"
      The parrot gave a squawk. "I've seen 'em, mate. The real McWossname. Some of the ones we've had in here, they'd make you choke on your millet. Great scaly fiery wossnames. Took weeks to get the soot off the walls," it added, in an approving tone of voice. "That was in his granddad's day, of course. The kid hasn't been any good at it. Up to now. Bright lad. I blame the wossnames, parents. New money, you know. Wine business. Spoil him rotten, let him play with his wossname's old stuff, `Oh, he's such an intelligent lad, nose always in a book`," the parrot mimicked. "They never give him any of the things a sensitive growing wossname really needs, if you was to ask me."
      "What you mean love and guidance?" said Rincewind.
      I was thinking of a bloody good wossname, thrashing," said the parrot.
      Rincewind clutched at his aching head. If this was what demons usually had to go through, no wonder they were always so annoyed.
      "Polly want a biscuit," said the parrot vaguely, in much the same way as a human would say "Er" or "As I was saying", and went on, "His granddad was keen on it. That and his pigeons."
      "Pigeons," said Rincewind

      "It's a demon that comes and has a headache at you."

      Demons have existed on the Discworld for at least as long as the gods, who in many ways they closely resemble. The difference is basically the same as that between terrorists and freedom fighters.
      Most of the demons occupy a spacious dimension close to reality, traditionally decorated in shades of flame and maintained at roasting point. This isn't actually necessary, but if there is one thing that your average demon is, it is a traditionalist.
      In the centre of the inferno, rising majestically from a lake of lava substitute and with unparalleled views of the Eight Circles, lies the city of Pandemonium.[5] At the moment, it was living up to its name.

      There are those who believe knowledge is something that is acquired - a precious

      There are those who believe that knowledge can only be recalled, that there was
      some Golden Age in the distant past when everything was known and the stones
      fitted together so you could hardly put a knife between them, you know, and
      it's obvious they had flying machines, right, because of the way the earthworks

      Studies. 'This is Woddeley's Basic Gods. There's some stuff here about lares and
      penates that seems to it the bill.'
      'Lares and penates? What were they when they were at home?' said Ridcully.
      'Hahaha,' said the Chair.
      'What?' said Ridcully.
      'I thought you were making a rather good joke, Archchancellor,' said the Chair.
      'Was I? I didn't mean to,' said Ridcully.

*** Introduction
**** What is Socio-Institutional Action?

     Human behaviour operates on numerous levels of
     abstraction. Individual, personal relations such as family
     and friends. Institutional interactions in schools and
     churches. More abstracted interactions such as mass media,
     with cultural norms and values even further abstracted. All
     of these combine to create the rich and complex society and
     social interactions that we observe every day.

     Current computational social models focus primarily on the
     less abstracted, interpersonal interactions of
     individuals, in the form of games like Prom Week and
     Versu. On the other end of the scale there are 4X games such
     as Civilisation that deal with highly abstracted concepts of
     society. Between these two extremes is a level of human
     behaviour currently invisible in computational models and
     game design. Let us define this intermediate level of
     behaviour as Socio-Institutional Action (SIA).

     SIA characterises behaviour that bridges interpersonal
     interactions with structurally modifying consequences. The
     easiest example of SIA is politics. The ways in which
     individuals in positions of power define and create the laws
     by which others live. Consider the personal interactions
     that are required in tv shows such as House of Cards and The
     West Wing to bring about political actions.

**** What is it different from?

     SIA contrasts significantly with the majority of current
     architectures, games, and discussions. Structural Change in
     games is typically a factor of the narrative rather than the
     system within which a player operates. Games such as
     Civilisation presumes no resistance to making changes to a
     society. Prom Week does not question the system which in a
     school prom occurs and does not model the power
     differentials of teachers to students. The Sims lets players
     control agents behaviours and accomodations, but not the
     society in which they operate. SimCity Societies approaches
     concerns of different societies, but, as Fable 3 does,
     limits itself to societal traits with relatively little
     freedom. Democracy 3 abstracts political change and relies
     on explicitly defined policies.

     In contrast, consider The Wolf Among Us, and Dragon Age
     Origins. They place particular individuals in positions that
     will decide the fate of many others. Unfortunately, they are
     explicitly authored narratives, rather than simulated
     societal changes.

**** Why is it important?

     Videogames are well suited to explore through simulation
     issues challenging society at the moment. The possibility of
     being able to role play in varieties of different social
     configurations can provide a large number of learning
     experiences. Institutionalised racism, command rape,
     discrimination, welfare. Simulated societies provide the
     possibility for individuals to understand the challenges
     facing those who are different.

     One simple example would be a computational implementation
     of Rawl's 'Veil of Ignorance' thought
     experiment. Implementing the capability of players to select
     the rules by which a society works, without having control
     or foreknowledge of their own position in society, is a
     compellingly different gameplay experience.

**** What are some good examples of it?

     In games, examples of actual SIA's are few and far between. Some of
     the best examples are recent Telltale games like the Wolf Among Us and
     Tales from the Borderlands. Games that place critically important
     decisions to shape the future course, not of a narrative, but of a
     society within a narrative, in the hands of the player. Fable 3
     attempted something along those lines as well.

     In realms less game related, the West Wing, Neal
     Stephenson's Anathem, and Robert Greene's the 48 Laws of
     Power all provide numerous examples of individuals being in
     the right place at the right time to change the course of a
     society.

**** Research Questions
     A number of research questions arise once the concept of SIA
     has been brought to the fore, primarily:

***** How can we describe Socio-Institutional Actions?
***** Can we create dynamic societies within which SIA's can occur?
***** Can dynamic societies provide new media experiences?
***** How might we utilize dynamic societies in games?

    Socio-institutional action, a level of individually observable
    behaviour that takes into account more than personal motivations. The
    majority of games and AI today have statically allocated allegiances
    to factions, global communicative behaviour, and global cultural
    norms. By foregrounding the social organisation of groups of agents, a
    different type of social behaviour can be modelled.

    Consider this problem from another angle. Current understandings of
    action, and the criteria by which we judge 'social' intelligence in
    AI, stems heavily from an ethnocentric viewpoint of modern, western
    cultures. There are games such as Unrest and Never Alone are starting
    to explore non-western and non-modern cultural descriptions. However,
    the majority of games, even when dealing with fantasy settings such as
    Skyrim, typically do not stray far from modern cultural concepts.

    Consider a comparison between Skyrim and Metro:2033. In Skyrim
    traveling to a different city does not bring about any important
    changes in behaviour or social norms. I can rest assured that there
    will be traders, a market economy, houses for families,and so on. I do
    not need to consider that there will be vastly different social norms
    as to how to successfully greet npc's, nor that i need to pay
    attention to individuals behaviours to be able to survive.

    Contrast this, somewhat, with Metro:2033. Although much more linear,
    each metro station has it's own atmosphere, politics, and
    allegiances. The factions are still static, but at least I get the
    sense that they each have their own sets of values rather than being
    cardboard cutouts of each other. The Reich, the Reds, the
    Rangers... each have goals that can be expressed in opposition to the
    other factions.

    Now consider fiction such as Altered Carbon, or Gormenghast. In these,
    there are multiple layers of social norms, centuries of tradition,
    and goals that group individuals together. Part of the attraction of
    seeing the characters in these works manipulate their situations is
    that some things are inviolable, while others are not.

    How could such variation and fluidity be achieved? There do exist social
    simulations that enable individuals to have personal goals, and
    interact with other agents in broad and complex ways. Yet there is no
    capability to manipulate structural aspects of their lives. They can
    not have realisable political goals.

    Such viewpoints may bring about useful and novel play
    experiences. Rawl's Veil of Ignorance is one such possibility if we
    can author societies instead of individuals. Allowing a player in an
    RPG to roll a society, with their character being placed in that
    society randomly, may enable a level of cultural criticism and
    exploration not currently feasible. Current events such as Trayvon
    Martin and Eric Garner have highlighted the consequences of ingrained
    cultural views on particular classes of people, both police and
    minorities. To be able to allow players to explore the difficulties of
    living in particular societies that on the face of it are entirely
    just, but only become problematic when power differences become
    apparent, would be a valuable contribution to society.

**** Theory
**** Sociology

     There is a whole host of sociological, philosophical, and
     anthropological literature that goes into various ways of describing
     and reasoning about such structures in human lives. Discussion of
     power by Bourdieu, Greene, and Levi-martin. Considerations of cultural
     structures include people such as Bill Bryson, Norbert Elias, and Ruth
     Benedict. There is a whole host of literature in organisational theory
     by Powell and Dimaggio, Fligstein and McAdam, and many others.

     All of the above examples provide usable resources with which to add
     higher level structures onto existing personally focused social models.

**** AI

     In applied Artificial Intelligence, there are the two primary social
     models of CiF and Praxis. There are considerations of continued
     actions interrupted by other higher importance actions by Bryson with
     Bod and Posh. Castelfranchi, spanning philosophy and AI, has
     considered different levels of social actions.

** Why Institutions are important for video-games                               :argument:

   Institutions are important because they structure almost all life, action, and systems.

*** Institutions are currently ignored in games

**** There has always been a bias to the physics in game systems.
     Mario. Donkey Kong. Modern Warfare. Minecraft. Even games like Dragon age, where
     dialogue and party interactions are praised, still rely primarily on (physical) combat systems.
     Even the Sims encodes a large amount of its word in physical smart objects.

     This is changing, with games like Prom Week, and Versu, placing more of a focus on social interactions,
     and social rules.

*** Institutions provide structure to social rules
    Currently, CiF collects rules into 'micro-theories', and Versu into 'social practices'.
    In the words of Josh McCoy, micro-theories are 'big bags of rules'. The complexity of institutions can surely
    be described better than this.

*** Institutions fill the structuring role of narrative and story in real life interactions.
*** Institutional changes themselves can be the focus of narrative.
    See Red Mars, and Gormenghast.

***** Phenomenological models and portrayals of Institutions are shallow and lacking
      There has started to be some (Paper's Please, We Happy Few), but they are the exception.
** Kant-sellars                                                                 :philosophy:multiple_languages:

   Videogame politics shift since the election? Versu simulates people, giving
   them a language of desires. If social structures are also modelled with a
   language of desires and rituals, let the individuals modify the institutions.
   Instutions will model the individuals who determine the modifications

   12 steps to writing a review

   Make sure you have the right expertise (check out our post, Are you the right
   reviewer?).

   Go to the journal web page to learn any specific instructions for reviewers.
   Check the manuscript fits in the journal format and the references are
   standardised (if the editor has not already done so).

   Skim the paper very quickly to get a general sense of it. Underline key words
   and arguments, and summarise key points. This will help you quickly “tune in”
   to the paper during the next read.

   Sit in a quiet place and read the manuscript critically (see here for our top
   12 tips). Make sure you have the tables, figures and references visible. Ask
   yourself key questions, including: does it have a relevant title and valuable
   research question? Are key papers referenced? What’s the author’s motivation
   for the study and the idea behind it? Are the data and tools suitable and
   correct? What’s new about it? Why does that matter? Are there other
   considerations?

   Take notes about the major, moderate and minor revisions that need to be
   made.

   Create a list of things to check. For example, do the referenced studies
   actually show what is claimed in the paper?

   Assess language and grammar, and make sure it’s a right “fit” for the
   journal. Does the paper flow – does it have connectivity? Does it have
   clarity – are the words and structure concise and effective?

   Check previous publications of the authors and of other authors in the field
   to be sure that the results were not published before.

   Confirm there are no common errors present (see here for common research
   flaws to watch out for).

   Summarise your notes for the editor (overview, contribution, strengths and
   weaknesses, acceptability). You can also include the manuscript’s
   contribution/context for the authors (really just to clarify whether you view
   it similarly, or not), then prioritise and collate the major revisions and
   minor/specific revisions into feedback. Try to compile this in a logical way,
   grouping similar things under a common heading where possible, and numbering
   them for ease of reference.

   Give specific recommendations for changes in the manuscript that the authors
   can address. In total you should be looking at a review that’s around two to
   three pages (four maximum) in length.

   Give your recommendation to the editor.

   1. Do you have a conflict of interest when reviewing this paper? Do you
      collaborate with these authors, are they your personal friends, or are
      they direct competitors? Have you reviewed (and rejected) this paper
      before? If so, you need to let the editors know.

   2. Do the title and abstract cover the main aspects of the work, would it spark
      interest to the right audience?

   3. Is the Introduction easy to follow for most readers of this particular
      journal? Does it cite the appropriate papers? Does it provide a hypothesis or
      aim of the study?

   4. Does the Methods section provide enough details for the general reader to
      repeat the experiments?

   5. If you skip the Methods, does the Results section give the right amount of
      detail to understand the basic details of the experiments?

   6. Do the Results refer to the figures in a logical order? Do the numbers in the
      tables add up correctly? Are any figures/tables mislabeled or unclear?

   7. Given the data that was obtained in this study, did the authors perform all
      the logical analyses? Did they include the proper controls?

   8. Does the Discussion address the main findings, and does it give proper
      recognition to similar work in this field?

   9. In general, is the paper easy to follow and does it have a logical flow? Are
      there any language issues?

   10. Did the authors make all their data (e.g. sequence reads, code,
       questionnaires used) available for the readers?

   11. Is this paper novel and an advancement of the field, or have other people
       done very similar work?

   12. Finally (and hopefully you will never have to answer yes to any of these
       questions): Does the paper raise any ethical concerns? Any suspicion of
       plagiarism (text or experiments), duplicated or tampered images, lack of IRB
       approval, unethical animal experiments, or "dual use of research concern"?
** [[https://publons.com/blog/6-common-research-flaws-to-watch-out-for-in-peer-review/][Common flaws of research]]

   1. Inappropriate study design for the study aims

   A study’s design is crucial to obtaining valid and scientifically sound results.
   Familiarise yourself with those commonly used in your field of research. If you
   come across an uncommon study design, read the researchers’ use and
   justification of it carefully, and question how it might affect their data and
   analysis. Review the study design critically but also remember to be
   open-minded. Just because something is new and unfamiliar it does not
   automatically mean it is incorrect or flawed.

   2. Deviating from standard/best practice and methodologies

   Similar to the above. The methods section, for example, should explain the steps
   taken to produce the results. If these are not clear or you’re left questioning
   their validity, it’s important to make your concerns known. And if they are
   unusual then, as with the study design, examine the researchers’ justification
   carefully with the view to ask more questions if necessary. Nonacademic
   discourse is another deviation from best practice whereby opinionated and biased
   statements are used throughout the study.

   3. Over-interpretation of results

   Over-interpretation has no place in research. Ensure the conclusions drawn in
   the paper are based on the data presented and are not extrapolated beyond that
   (to a larger population or ecological setting, for example). You should also
   watch out for studies that focus on seemingly important differences where none
   exist.

   4. Commenting beyond the scope of the article

   “That’s beyond the scope of this paper” is a common phrase in academic writing.
   As a reviewer, watch out for papers that include comments or statements not
   pertaining to the research project and data at hand.

   5. Lack of evidence to support conclusions

   A research paper’s concluding statements must be justified and evidence-based.
   If you’re not convinced of the results, it could mean the researchers need to
   clarify aspects of their methodological procedure, add more references to
   support their claims, or include additional data or further analysis.

   6. Too many words

   A common pain point in manuscripts is that it’s too wordy. It’s important to
   keep check on this scenario and encourage clear, concise and effective text
   where possible. Too many words can be distracting for the reader, which at best
   could cause them to lose interest and at worst could lead to them
   misinterpreting the research.

*** Theories and Concepts

    Approach technologies as congealed labour; doing so expands what
    “technology” means and underscores the embodied work and material histories
    at play from ideation and patenting to manufacturing and maintenance.
    Technologies are not only things; they are processes, too. (See Mayer;
    reading optophone; Crawford and Joler.)

    Ask who benefits most from automation and novelty; doing so attends to how
    planned obsolescence and deskilling affect various groups of people.
    Automation may increase efficiency or productivity in some areas, but it
    most certainly shapes craft and changes demands for occupations and forms of
    expertise. (See Luddites; Crawford and Joler; Pedercini.)

    Recognize when projects aestheticize the politics of their technologies;
    doing so addresses how values are expressed through design as well as
    through terms such as “user-friendly,” “fast,” “sleek,” “convenient,” and
    even “minimalist.” Design may be politics by seemingly apolitical means.
    (See Parker; McPherson; Crawford and Joler.)

    Engage directly the power of technology; doing so foregrounds how and why a
    given technology could oppress groups of people, or be used to resist
    oppression. Technology is not only an object but also a force, and it is
    entangled with issues of race, gender, sexuality, extraction, and ability.
    (See Nakamura; Nelson; Case; Pedercini.)

    Examine the “default settings” of technologies; doing so asks for whom, by
    whom, and under what assumptions they are designed, and who they may exclude
    and enable. All projects have intended audiences, even if those intentions
    are not always conscious or deliberate. (See Skawennati; Nelson; Nakamura.)

    Avoid flattening society to a market or venue for products; doing so
    recognizes how social norms, contexts, and behaviours shape production, too.
    Society is a generalization and abstraction as well as a situation and
    practice that influences technologies. (See Hendler; McPherson.)

    Try to locate technologies in their supply chains; doing so addresses their
    dependencies and conditions of production, not to mention people’s
    complicity with anonymous materials. Technologies persist within and through
    vast and complex infrastructures, which are incredibly difficult to study.
    (See Pedercini; Crawford and Joler; Le Guin.)

    Pair “media” (plural) with “the media” (singular); doing so affords an
    understanding of the relationships between content and a platform, messages
    and a network, formats and a venue, communications and an outlet,
    representation and a system. Media may be windows (through), portals (to),
    frames (around), links (between), containers (in), addresses (at),
    negotiations (with), agents (for), and records (of). (See Nakamura; Case;
    Sullivan et al.; Morgan-Parmett.)

    Note the everyday aspects of technology; doing so stresses the centrality of
    habits and standards to development. Consider, for instance, how QWERTY
    shapes your language and writing habits, or how HTTP protocols control the
    web. Technologies are not only whiz-bang spectacles but also humdrum
    routines; most of the time, they are rather boring. (See Borges; Bush.)

    Consider parthood alongside forms and wholes; doing so traces the components
    of technologies in archives and collections as well as in patents and
    claims. Technologies don’t descend from the sky or spring from the minds of
    lone inventors; they are assembled and maintained. (See Tennis for Two;
    phonautograph; Rosner et al.; Parker.)

    Refrain from reducing technologies to only metaphors, experiences, or tech
    specs, or to only digital or analog processes; doing so acknowledges how
    talking about technology is entwined with using it, making it, and repairing
    it. All technical matters are also social and cultural matters. (See
    McPherson; Rosner et al.; Nakamura.)

    Remember that data are produced, not given or captured; doing so emphasizes
    how this becomes that, or how data is structured, collected, and expressed
    for interpretation. (See Greg and Nafus; Crawford and Joler.)

    Read any list like this one with a healthy dose of skepticism. Generosity of
    interpretation goes a long way, but gaps make bridges possible, and bias
    fuels advice. What’s missing from the list? How does it communicate? What
    motivates it? What does it assume? What does it want? How does it reflect a
    discipline or a moment in time?
***  Practices

    Experiment across a spectrum of critical work; doing so values both distance
    and immersion. Try writing about technologies or composing critiques of them
    while also thinking with and through them. Researchers are not outside what
    they study, yet they should be aware of and reflect upon their influence and
    biases. (See Rosner et al.; Sullivan et al.; Morgan-Parmett; Barchas.)

    Ask for permission before working with or circulating materials, and give
    credit where credit’s due; doing so privileges consent, licensing,
    attribution, and compensation in the research process. After all, the
    materials may not be yours to use or share. (See fair dealing; Nelson;
    Skawennati; Sullivan et al.; Le Guin.)

    Conjecture with affordances; doing so demonstrates how design is relational.
    It happens between people, environments, and things; it’s not just a quality
    or property of objects. (See Parker; Barchas; Rosner et al.)

    Produce your own time and space through technologies; doing so may help you
    to project a world or speculate about one. Space and time are their own sort
    of media. They act upon us, but we can also compose with them. (See Nelson;
    Skawennati; Morgan-Parmett; Sullivan et al.)

    Articulate your position on openness; doing so stresses how dissemination is
    only one step in the production process. For example, open data is useful,
    but people also need to know where it came from, how it was produced and
    with whose consent, and how to interpret it. (See black box; Gregg and
    Nafus; Crawford and Joler; Le Guin.)

    Determine what your project will help people to compile or “re-member”;
    doing so foregrounds how technologies are agents of memory and forgetting.
    Through automation and design, they assemble parts, compile components, and
    refresh files. Or, they keep things found for you. (See Borges; Parker;
    Bush.)

    Address the ghosts; doing so helps to engage (instead of avoid or discount)
    the unknowns of your project, including its histories and futures. Even
    though we may not comprehend or apprehend how they work, technologies alone
    do not explain the past, solve pressing issues, or fix the future. They are
    components of social and cultural processes. (See Rosner et al.; Sullivan et
    al.; Le Guin.)

    Ask yourself where your project will be in ten, twenty, or even fifty years;
    doing so prompts attention to maintenance and obsolescence. If you want your
    project to stick around, then facilitate preservation and repair now rather
    than later. (See Tennis for Two; phonautograph; reading optophone.)

    Where useful, value ephemerality and even magic as media; doing so may
    increase creativity and/or decrease pressure. Not all ideas, processes, and
    experiments need to be documented or tracked, and not everything about a
    project must be rationalized or demystified. (See phonautograph; Sullivan et
    al.; Barchas; Case.)

    Involve your audience; doing so helps to avoid reducing them to only users
    or consumers. It may also prompt some informative feedback and needed
    critique. (See Rosner et al.; Sullivan et al.)

    Don’t reinvent the wheel, and be leery of over-investing in either novelty
    or failing; doing so may help to bypass the competitive tendencies and
    attention economics of design and development. Tweaking or customizing an
    existing technology may afford a lot; it may also reduce scope and feature
    creep. (See Tennis for Two; phonautograph; Sullivan et al.)

    Make a useless or disinterested version of your project; doing so may
    underscore the creative and critical dimensions of technology and society.
    After all, not all technologies must increase productivity or efficiency.
    Consider the roles of technologies in art, theory, and storytelling. (See
    Parker; Case.)
***  Prototyping Techniques

    Paper: Use paper to make a simple version of your project. Changes,
    especially structural changes, may be easier when you’re working with index
    cards and pencils. (But sometimes software is indeed easier and/or better.
    Your call!)

    Patent Search: Search patent databases for wholes and parts corresponding
    with your project. Many ideas are patented but never mass-manufactured. Also
    consider common components of patents: title, date (applied and granted),
    drawing (exploded view, perspective, and section), background (history and
    motivation), description (what it does), claims (dependent and independent),
    and name(s) of who filed it.

    2D/3D Translation: Use paper, plasticine, sticks, cardboard, or software to
    reconstruct a 2D drawing in 3D. Or, use pen, paper, or software to represent
    a 3D object in 2D. The translation process should give you a sense of how
    perspective is biased (or limited) as well as how to relate with a given
    object in time and space.

    Wireframing: Sketch your project’s form and interface without focusing much,
    if at all, on content. Wireframes provide a good sense of how people may
    interact with your project, and they don’t require any programming. They are
    also opportunities to talk about scope and feature creep (before the project
    is too far along).

    Exploded-View Drawing: Express your project as a constellation of parts and
    relations. Exploded-view drawings have been used for centuries to
    demonstrate how things come together.

    Emulation/Migration/Collection: Prototype how your project would be imitated
    or reproduced with software (emulation), how it would be treated as data or
    a repository of files (migration), and how it would be preserved as a system
    of hardware, software, wires, and whatnot (collection). These prototypes may
    provide a sense of your project’s near future.

    Old/New Media: Make old and new media versions of your project and then
    compare their affordances. Following Lev Manovich, new media are represented
    numerically, automated, variable, modular, and transcoded (both
    computational/technical and cultural).

    Media Survey: Describe your project through a survey of media variously
    defined. Media may connect but also draw boundaries between this and that.
    Try describing your project as a window (through), portal (to), frame
    (around), link (between), container (in), address (at), negotiation (with),
    agent (for), and record (of). This list isn’t exhaustive, but it’s a start.
    It may help to articulate a language for your project.

    Index/Icon/Symbol: Render your project as an index (such as data, which
    points to something), an icon (such as an image that represents an app on
    your phone), and symbols (such as a tagline of words that produce meaning
    for people). This approach underscores how your project is not only designed
    but also communicated.

    Reverse-Engineering: Find a thing resembling your project, take it apart,
    trace the parts and their histories, and put the thing back together.
    Document the process and reflect on how it pertains to technology as
    congealed labour. (You can also have someone else reverse-engineer your
    project.)

    Personas: Create fictional characters to better understand a past or future
    scenario for your project. Use the personas to address how such
    representations are reductive and problematic yet quite common in marketing.
    You can also use personas to highlight how and why you cannot inhabit the
    past.

    Force Map: Integrate your personas into a static illustration with a setting
    (time and place), concerns (expressed by the personas), media (what mediates
    the concerns and relations between personas), and relations (lines
    connecting personas and concerns). This map should illustrate your project
    as a social and material process. It should also reveal what you don’t (yet)
    know.

    Use Story: Animate your personas and force map by storyboarding a context of
    use for your project. Try 3-6 panels of content, which may resemble a comic
    book or graphic novel. Perform and even video-record the storyboard, if you
    wish. Storyboarding situates otherwise abstract representations (such as
    exploded-view drawings) and foregrounds the importance of embodied
    experiences and social relations to project design and development.

    Playtest or Workshop: Circulate your project for feedback. Give groups
    specific problems or issues on which to focus. Later, conduct another
    workshop, where you don’t intervene or guide the participants; be a fly on
    the wall, observe them interacting with your project, and take notes.

    Datification: Prototype your project with data in mind. Cook up a data model
    (entities, attributes for each entity, and relations between entities), some
    sample data, and an example of use. For whom is the data produced? By whom?
    How? Under what assumptions? How transparent is the process? How do people
    consent to and participate in it? Such prototypes should prompt
    considerations of control, surveillance, play (or gamification), and labour.

    Dystopia/Utopia: Integrate your datification into two dramatically different
    scenarios: one where the results are ostensibly positive, and one where the
    results are ostensibly negative. Articulate why you think the results are
    positive and negative, and also why technology is even necessary to achieve
    them.

    Design Brief: Compose a design brief for your prototype. Include your
    project’s social aim (a specific social issue supported by peer-reviewed
    research), intended audience (a specific group for whom your project is
    designed), context (a particular place or situation), core parts (the
    primary ingredients of your prototype), aesthetics (affordances, or how your
    prototype engages people), responsibilities (what the project may change or
    affect, who will be responsible for those changes, and how), and focus (what
    the project won’t or doesn’t do). Provide example materials, too, such as
    illustrations, wireframes, photographs, code, video, and/or tactile
    prototypes. Design briefs are often written by firms and oriented toward
    clients or customers, but this version is intended to engage the TS 200
    course material.

  I think of games simulated from a middle level, bi-directionally instead of bottom up or top down. Social interactions of a level of complexity that physical violence is able to take the centre focus.
  Social interactions that can form the society around it. A balance of politics, norms, and symbolic actions that complex structures can be the focus.

  Steam, as a tool for the selection, rather than purchase of large numbers of games, is somewhat lacking. My own vignette demonstrates how finding a game is not necessarily an easy, straight forward thing to do.
  browsing, navigating, and selecting from a large selection of games is trivialised as previously there was a limit on how much media was available at your finger tips.
  with cloud services that can provide a vast collection of media, beyond  what any private library would have been able to hold at any point in human history, means that we need better navigation techniques.
  at the moment it remains a structured search because sometimes, due to economics, there are times what you don't want to buy a new game. You want to play one of a vast number you,
  or possibly your ancestors DRM'd library in the steam/netflix/amazon/apple library where you own the item in question.
  think of what a society might look like, when robots have taken over producing jobs, and people are left with a purely social currency of the items of media that they own.

  and the children of actions, to promote things that need to be created. colour by how much is in there, specifying your own colour scale domain.

  metasteam needs a search, and a reasonable depiction of a game page. preferably still something faster than booting up the steam store page. could download the page and keep the images?
  downloading already... i'll look into scraping for the images.
  buttons to youtube, and look into downloading from a twitter timeline to annotate tweets that were timed during when a game was being played.

  having a small number of guaranteed users, will let me work with them to debug the installation.

  extending metasteam's visualisations only requires d3, the datastructure, and a file that implements the three methods. + the metasteam general definitions.

  intro. main stats, circle pack game tags. pie game tags. release timeline. playtime calendar. Multiplayer populations. co-occur matrix of tags by game.

  need a game visualisation method of hub, or any other standardised method for everything to call.




  need to start authoring. simple institutions.
  simple institutions like what?
  war, physical violence and enforcement. punishment.
  physical good production
  bartering
  social events. a funeral. a celebration.



  hierarchies of order. why would you obey the non-physical, non-violent punishments of boarding school?

  load in other data structures like cif rules or anytown classes to construct a starting tree? add in democracy values and institutions?


  social reinforcement in all areas. promote the values, items, actions, people etc that you agree with for some reason, or like, or if it reminds you of something you like, to
  varying strengths.

  speaking of which: the automatic balancing of comparisons to begin with is something i should test more fully.

  be creating structured filters. when displaying a list by search or by inference, be able to add a series of conditions to filter by. then showing other categories.
  so (for parents and children):
  specified elements: x
  y
  z
  assertedButUntested:(xyz) + a
  untestedButAsserted:(xyz) + b
  testedAndAsserted  (xyz) + c


  how do i create new macro classes? copy to a temporary description, edit to abstractness, save as template, instantiate where needed with annotations for reconnections.

  rules are just nodes visualised in a different way. be able to switch back and forth as necessary
  let conditions be filters on specific nodes that you locate in the graph.
  new condition root.institution.actor..... etc
  updating the left half of the screen as necessary
  same for effects/actions.
  could add in abl semantics, and rule-abl semantics, whatever they would be.
  mainly ability to describe parallel/sequential structural inforcments, in a similar way to what versu does.


  abstract the interface to fit into the metasteam framework. different modes are different visualisations and combinations of commands, operating on structures that are capable of visualising them
  Such modes are themselves structures that could fit on the graph. But mainly they are isomorphisms describing different domains of reasoning over the graph.
  The basic mode is structural at the moment. Rules add transformational. Facts add a existential component. Could add probabilistic isomorphism.
  Isomorphisms group other isos together in different ways, and can reference each other through interfaces.
  Each isomorphism describes a components:

  1) commands that can be enacted on the main Shell's graph, ie: addNode, removeNode, addSpecialNode (eg: addCondition), setValue, compile, enact...
  2) transform of data from the graph,
  3) display rules of that transformed data, ie: D3 visualisations
  4) the structures that can be added to the basic graph, that act as the iso's model or representational structures. ie: constructors for nodes, conditions, macros (eg: institutions) that could have an isomorphism later
  5) help information

  anything else?
  6) assessment routine. can use rules, but if a different structure is created, it can have its own separate eval routine. eg: CiFs volition rules.

  possibly be able to  write custom execution functions for nodes.
  json export and representation to/from json could be cleaned up.


  need to add exceptions to the retenet.
* A Socio-Institutional Approach to Action                                      :writing:
  Towards a strategic capability for abuse of power in dynamic, embodied, social
  characters.

** Forms of action
   Potentially through the application of naive bayes learning and
   classification to decision making for understanding social
   norms. Using the naive bayes to classify potential actions into
   social, unsocial categories, using preannotated culture tags as the features.
   then steadily retraining as the agent experiences more and more.


   CiF and Praxis both assume agents that interact will 'play the same
   game' so to speak. An agent, in their decision process, is assuming
   that not only is there a set of rules governing a social practice, but
   that social practice is the same between players.

   i) There are a set of rules that govern Chess, Q in Agent A's mind.
   There are a set of rules that govern Backgammon, R, in Agent B's mind.
   if R = Q, A and B can play together.

   What happens if we then define the games further:

   ii) There are a tuple of Rules and Actions for Chess, (Q,T) in Agent A's mind.
   There are a tuple of Rules and Actions for Backgammon, (R,S) in Agent B's mind.
   if (Q,T) = (R,S) then A and B can play
   if Q = R but T != S
   or Q != R but T = S, (either rules or actions are the same) then with clarification,
   adjudication, or translation, A and B can play.

   Games, even with different names, can be played if the rules and actions are able to be aligned.

   iii) Let N be a metric for the similarity of Q and R in the range of 0 - 1.
   Let M be a metric for the similarity of T and S in the range of 0 - 1.
   Then as N (and? or?) M -> 0, A and B become unable to play.
   As N (and? or?) M -> 1, A and B become able to play.

   Conversely, through a set of strategies, there can be a reduction of
   rule and action set alignment. This would reduce or remove the ability
   to allow play.

   In between these two 'extremes' of playing a shared game, and not
   playing, there is a grey area where the rules are in a state of
   uncertainty and conflict.  If the agents are socially aware, and
   capable of playing more than one game, at which they might be better
   at one than another, they can attempt to ensure the clarification of a
   game resolves to a game they are better at than another.

   Now instead of focusing on entire games, let the clarification be a
   certain amount of construction of the game from rule and action
   fragments.
* Error and Social Action                                                       :writing:
  Machine learning error squared. A representation of the real data to the model,
  penalising for outliers.
  When it comes to social action.. it is costly to fully model every
  element of every person to know the consequences of your action.
  So aggregate across generalisations for everyone

  The error of such action is the difference between resulting
  consequences from actual consequences? used to weight expectations?

  Versu stress tested choice points... could you run random combinations
  of rules and learn instances of combinations?
* Cyclical Myth                                                                 :myth:
   "Being able to really change the rules of the word is a form of heroic journey"
