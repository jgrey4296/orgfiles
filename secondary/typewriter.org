* Typewritten Notes
** Hierarchical scaling from norms to institutions
   re: Blockchain demo

   Many concepts will be explained through a sequence of increasingly
   complex systems. In the blockchain demo this progresses from a
   hash, to a block, to a blockchain etc.

   What is the equivalent pathway for institutions and systems of
   institutions?

   Rules of action -> Activities -> norms -> microtheories -> group
   norms -> social practices -> organisations -> institutions ->
   clusters -> culture


   Simple Activity theory Pyramid, expands to the full
   activity theory pyramid to account for norms. These lead to
   microtheories then group norms. Group norms lead to social
   practices, social practices combine to form
   organisations. Institutions are flexible structures above
   organisations. Institutions form clusters, and separate clusters of
   institutions form culture.

   *Agglomerative Authoring*
** Thoughts on Stack based approaches to conversation

   If conversation is treated as a stack, rather than a tree, it would
   simplify the tracking of topics.
   Would the conversation be simpler actually?
   What would the main operations be? Add, pop, replace?
   Would current options be limted to the top of the stack?
   Or would the converser have full access to the stack?
   Presumably some actions would clear the stack.
   Would it be a single stack? or would there be multiple ones for
   categories of conversation, or would each participant get a
   separate stack?

   Would conversational strategies that used statements fullfilling
   multiple stack entries be preferred or workable?
   or would elements on the stack be essentially atomic/ separate?

   Related to this is the topic of speech act modelling, DAMSL, and
   the way of pairing speech acts with surface representations?

   Rather than have performance as a component of a speech set, have
   them as separate data structures, with conditions on use such as
   template parameters which must be fulfilled.
   Then speech acts may be registered with particular performances and
   *multiple* performances, which could be selected after filtering by
   the fulfilled conditions at run time of the conversation.

   A Process for Authoring:
   1) Create performance level strings
   2) Annotate with variables
   3) Anotate with conditions
   4) Annotate with state changes
   5) Connect with graph of conversation topics
      1) connect as fsms?
   6) Run simulation to verify connectedness

** Isomorphism in Institutions
   Hofstadter goes into detail about isomorphisms and formal systems.
   Although institutions are not formal systems, they do resemble them
   to a certain degree. They do have a similar level of isomorphism
   between components of the institutional system, and actions.
   Particularly language to enable intelligible descriptions and
   communication.

   To this end, it would be useful to formalise the types of
   isomorphisms present in institutional systems, and describe a
   typology for the concepts representable within an institution.

   As a preliminary grouping, the following should be considered:
   1) Physical Objects
   2) Physical Actions
   3) Communicative descriptions of 1 and 2
   4) Physical interface concepts
   5) pure symbolic concepts
   6) time
   7) institutionally structuring concepts
   8) institutionally exported concepts
   9) Institutionally imported concepts

   Alt:
   Basic States and Fluents
   f(basic)
   Complex States and Fluents
   Symbolic
   ins_internal
   ins_public
   ins_consuming

   But what about norms, and structure in the symbolic state?


   With the understanding that further distinctions may become apparent
   at a later date.


   In a type system:
   States :: (Elstring, [Interface])
   Fluent :: ([Elstring] -> [Elstring], [Interface])
   Communication :: (Elstring -> String, [Interface])
   Interface :: ( Elstring -> Bool, [Interface])
   Symbolic :: ( Elstring, [Interface])
   Symbolic_Action :: (Symbolic -> Fluence -> Symbolic, [Interface])
   Time :: Elstring -> Elstring
   Institution :: {
   Internal_state :: [Symbolic],
   Available_actions :: [Symbolic_action],
   Exported_concepts :: ([Symbolic], [Symbolic_action])
   Consuming :: ([Symbolic], [Symbolic_action])
   }

** The Phenomenology of Institutions
   Institutions are generally thought of in large scale terms. They
   are societal behemoths, hard to change, organising large groups of
   people and behaviours. They are rarely characterised by their
   phenomenology.
   The experience of waiting in line at the dmv, joining the military
   or police, or working in an office. These situations are, in many
   ways, a more accurate portrayal of the institutions they are part
   of, and can more accurately represent differences in corruption,
   bureaucracy, and institutional variation. Yet such conceptions of
   institutions are unformalised and often neglected in current
   research.

   The question arises then of *How should we describe institutional
   phenomenologies?* Considering the nature of the problem, do the
   normal considerations of phenomenology (such as temporality,
   intentionality, facticity, dasein and authenticity) suffice, or do
   we need to account for the expanded social considerations at play?

** Procedural Institutions

*** Introduction
    What are institutions? Why should they be procedurally generated?
    Why haven't they been? Have institutions been modelled, or even
    described?

*** Background
    Weber onwards, sociologists into subsets of economists. Economists
    lead to computational social scienteists and
    multi-agent-systems. Always cellular autonoma
    representations. Contrast with character focused game
    representations and expressive media.

*** Theory
    Where Social Science and systems design meet expressive media.
    Structured rule systems intended to interact. Explicit input and
    output interfaces. T-boxes and Monadic Composition. Deontics.
    Subdivision into activities/ separated from activities?


*** Computational Artifacts
    Conversational maps, institutional progression paths, SoM-like
    character customisation, Monadic rule system composition.

*** Analysis
    Source analysis of games (existing) to identify similarities and
    evidence based meta categorisation.

*** Future work
    There are limitations on how far a procedural institution can go
    at the moment. Future work should aim towards greater flexibility,
    larger variations of rules, and increased isomorphism between
    rules and language.

*** Conclusion

** On the representation of conversation in games
   And the need for conversation mazes

   Conversations are, for a wide variety of social interactions,
   crucial. Representations of conversations however are severely
   lacking. Whether in the interactive fiction of Versu, or the
   Character focused RPGs of Mass Effect, to the classic styles of rpg
   like Baldurs Gate, conversation is typically represented and
   controlled, the same: Through conversation trees and selection of
   segments of speech that the conversational partner responds to.

   (Different needs of authoring vs playing. When Authoring you can
   move freely, when playing you need more info for moves, as you
   can't rewind.)

   These representations suffer from a number of weaknesses:
   1) Conversations are typically only two party affairs. (limited size)
   2) The player only knows the history of the conversation, and their
      available next moves. (limited control)
   3) The conversation is modelled as a graph, without being
      visualised as such, only as a tree. (impoverished representation)
   4) Conversations are sequences of pre-authored, but parameterised
      conversationa segments. (limited flexibility)

   To elaborate on point 2, I mean a player has no knowledge of *how
   the conversation might proceed*, as they only know their next
   immediate moves. Meanwhile for point 3, I mean that although a
   conversation will be represented as a set of nodes and edges which
   connect them, the player is only presented with the prior context
   and the nodes available, with minimal representation of how those
   nodes can contribute to the overall conversation.

   Two illustrating situations are: when a player wants to *leave* a
   conversation, and when the player is trying to make a *decision
   between different options*.

   1) If a player wants to end a conversation, but must navigate to a
      specific "Goodbye" speech act, this can result in frustration as
      they navigate the conversation graph a node at a time.

   2) If a player is presented with summaries of options such as "Be
      friendly" and "Be hostile", they may regret their choice when
      the resulting hostile speech act is stronger than they intended,
      or makes use of a piece of context the player did not
      intend. Eg: A hostile act in an otherwise friendly conversation
      that mocks the other participants dead parent.

   The above issues are weakenesses arising from the flawed
   representation of the conversation. How else might
   conversations, or the highly contextual and planned social
   interactions we participate in daily, be represented?
   (both in structure, interaction, procedure, and representation)

   One possibility is to present to the player a maze, or map, rather
   than a tree. In the same way that the map in the binding of isaac
   will present the item room, boss room, shop and other important
   rooms to the player, a maze of conversation can provide greater
   information and planning opportunities. It does not need to be a
   complete information map, and it could be dynamically updated. Yet
   if the end of the conversation and other important speech acts were
   displayed to the player, conversations would be alot more
   manageable.

   Example: adapt a conversation from fiction rather than write one?

   There are two main areas to solve regarding conversation mazes. The
   first is authoring/generating the maze to being with. The second is
   the representation, and how dynamic it should be and how much 'fog
   of war' there should be.

   Let us explore the concept with a minimally authored conversation.

** Towards the simulation and manipulation of Institutions
   Institutions - Their definition and applications to social
   simulation and videogames.

   The problem: Institutions are all around us, yet invisible, all
   powerful, but uncontrollable by individuals.

   To rectify this, institutions needto be described and modelled in
   games in such a way as to foreground the structures of our lives so
   often left implicit. The problem of foregrounding structures larger
   than individuals.

   Research Questions:
   1) How can Institutions be modelled and described?
   2) What would procedrually generated Institutions look like?
   3) Why would players/observers benefit from such simulations?
   4) How would players interact with the institutions?
   5) How would players enact changes on said institutions?

   Constraints of work:
   This work does not intend to accurately model the real world, to
   the point of making testable predictions, as this will be the first
   few steps in a much larger project, given the size and complexity
   of human institutions.

   By synthesising together the research from fields typically ignored
   by the videogame and expressive intelligence communities, I intend
   to provide a framework for the procedural generation of
   institutions. In particular, areas such as the New Institutionalism
   of Sociology; anthropology; and Multi-Agent-Systems research will
   be used for structure and examples. These can be integrated with the
   latest artificial intelligence applicable to games, namely rule
   systems, modal logics, grammars, and utility systems, to offer a
   system capable of filling the gaps in current research.

   Primarily, such a system needs to fulfill the following criteria:
   1) Rapid authoring of content (namely rules) to the scale of
      thousands of rules. (+Gui)
   2) Grammatical recombination of authored content into reasonably
      novel combinations of rule systems. (The coherence of which
      shall be discussed later).
   3) Structuring (through a type system?) of the rules to distinguish
      between content with strict and weak isomorphisms.
   4) Player/Agent triggered modifications to the rule sets that take
      advantage of those weak isomorphisms. (Politics?)

   Constraints: Socially inspired by not intending to accurately model
   yet.

   Examples - categorised - scales -ind/interpersonal - ind->group,
   societal.

   Existence proof of manipulable situations at each scale?


   *Requirements of modelling software*: System: functions, text-output,
   graphic manip, interfaces with tool/authoring shell, single-
   represent institution in data + procedure?
   State-transition-loop. Functional?

   Domain requirements? similarity to examples.

   user: turn-based non-realtime, natural language, graphical and
   behavioural portrayals of institutions, interactive/manipulable
   institutions.

   Verifiable system goals?

** On the scaling of institutional phenomenology
   As institutions broach all areas of modern human life, it will be
   useful to clarify the different scales upon which institutions can
   impact upon the individual.
   1) *The Direct* Here an individual feels the power of an
      institution in an *immediately perceivable* way, both in time
      and space. The police, as the direct application of force by the
      state, is a suitable example. Enforcement and enactment without
      modification. Sanctions.
   2) *The Indirect* Where an individual does not have an institution,
      or its enforcement, applied at a definitive time or by
      designated agents, but rather follows the *rules encoded* in the
      already established context they currently exist within. Eg:
      House zoning,or the rules of interaction (ie: the
      courts). Anti-homeless designs. The rules of the *IGU*.
   3) *The Normative* here the individual is constrained and
      influenced by the value systems and judgements of others who,
      while external to the system proper, have internalised its rules
      and structure.
   4) *Gatekeepers and Incumbents* Where there are individuals located
      in the structure of an institution who can, for a variety of
      reasons, modify (temporarily or permanently), the institution to
      help or hinder. The IGU proper.
   5) *The unmodifiable physical* Although a large amount of an
      institution is symbolic, there are physical principles that,
      presumably, must remain inviolable. Items must burn when set on
      fire, as a necessary condition for a fire department.

   What doesn't fit this typology?

   Scales:
   Gatekeepers ( symbolic),
   Unmodifiable (non-symbolic)
   Direct (Symbolic)
   Normative (symbolic)
   Indirect (symbolic)

   Towards institutional structure:
   Chained isomorphisms? (or are they something else?)
   Can institutions be stacked arbitrarily high? Looped?
   How do chained isomorphisms interact? across institutions?

   Describe two separate institution-layers, from the same base
   system. Not just physical by L2-4 as well?

   Monad-transformers of institutions?
   Stacking:
   Physical,
   indirect/environmental
   direct/enforcing
   gatekeepers
   normative/internalised

** The difficulties of authoring and visualistion (of trees)

   It is apparent that authoring behaviours and content comes with a
   number of challenges (mentioned by mccoy, evans, mateas [oz review,
   ai authoring tools], szilas, shen, ryan [modular content,
   composition representation, story recognition, story support]).

   *Structuring* (particularly for tree based representations) which
   breaks down as the size of data increases, and
   *combinatino/declaration of interactions* which also suffers as
   more content is added.
   *Visualising* what is typically represented as a tree has
   limitations. The single node based representation used for
   animation, and rule systems like cif shows promise.

   This still leaves how to address interactions. Here I propose
   using a tag based system, with all inputs and outputs to
   nodes/rules being tagged. The aim is to have the system propose
   and highligh conflicts. (ai supported authoring).

   Louchart.
   Riedl - authorial intent, character autonomy.
   Evans - Speed of authoring, feedback, interface, coordination,
   continuity, freewill, complexity of concurrent practices,
   in-game-character creation.

   Authoring:
   Tracking (changes/updates),
   Visualistion (trees/nodes), (Growth of complexity),
   Debugging (combinations, bad combinations, testing, seeing effects
   of new entries)
   Structuring (recursive, patterns)
   Planning (pre-authoring)
   Creation (typically spreadsheets, recursive)

   Solution:
   Reduced effort of input and navigation (shell),
   testing
   tagging
   single node visualisation

             utility
          2) constitutive norms

          3) burden of proof
*** Types of norms:
    1) Termporal
    2) contextual
    3) determinative - define, constitutive
    4) technical procedure
    5) prescriptions - deontics
    6) conventions - sanction-less

    8) r-norms - created by authority

*** Enforcement:
    1) Disapproval
    2) internalisation
    3) voluntary coordination

    3) Prescriptions - values

    Structure -> identify
    Identify -> change, apply
    Change -> structure, conditions
    Conditions -> apply
    Apply -> change?

    Permission, disability, obligation, claim, power (legal, physical),
    immunity, duty, right, liability.
*** Norms
    1) Join Agreement
    2) need to be connected to physical reality in some way.

       greedy?
    5) violations

    6) Structure
       1) Group norms
          1) fulfilling group norms signifies belonging to group
             morals, promotion of value similarities
          2) institutional entrepreneurs can violate but belong?
    7) Prohibition
    8) Obligation
    9) regimented norms - physical

    11) violations
    12) incentives
    13) deterrents
    14) hierarchy of violence
    15) norms -> consequences -> control -> others/ environment

    Private attitudes are not observable.
    Types of norm depend on the richness of social reality, concepts
    that are available, and whether the individual has motivational
    attitudes in relation to them.

    Because norms cannot always be implemented physically, it is
    remedied by constructing rigid interaction patterns where control
    resides always outside the individual.

*** NMAS Definitions
    1) Social Definition
       System governed by restrictions on pattersm of behaviour
       1) transmitted
       2) social function
       3) social impact
       4) contextual
       5) prescriptive
       6) followable
    2) Norm Change
       System in which agents decide to follow explicitly represented
       norms, and also modify norms
       Requires clarification of norm types
       RQ: how and why norms can be changed?,
       RQ: if agents can violate norms
    3) Mechanism Design
       System organized by mechanisms to:
       1) represent
       2) communicate
       3) distribute
       4) detect
       5) create
       6) modify
       7) enforce
       8) deliberate
       9) detect vioations
       10) detect fulfilment
*** Problems
    1) Relation of power and permission
    2) how to specify contexts
    3) how to design a system that implements a set of norms
    4) how to check for normative system compliance
    5) how do norms contribute to design agents organizations
    6) roles of norms in societies
    7) relation of games and norms
    8) how to ensure norms are followable
    9) how to deal with normative awareness

*** Guidelines
    1) motivate definition of nmas:
       1) (strong) declarative norms)
       2) (weak) system spec norms
       3) other
    2) make explicit why norms are a soft constraint
    3) explain how and why norms can be changed at runtime
    4) discuss the use of norms in game theory settings
    5) clarify role of norms as part of institution

    If any illegal behaviour is just ruled out by the specification:
    1) we are unable to spec what should happen if such illegal
       behaviour occurs
    2) we fail to adopt a meaningful concept of norm
    3) agents cannot violate norms, so we do not model autonomy

    One of the peculiar features of the law is that it necessarily
    takes the form of a dynamic normative system.

** Examples/Fiction                                                             :examples:
*** Night Watch
    Vetinari <-> Guilds / City Nobles
    Vimes -> Vetinari, Angua, Carrot, Detritus, etc

    Vimes sets policy,
    Anguage and Carrot enforce it,
    Detritus inducts trainees into appropriate behaviour
    Information and feedback is passed up the chain as well
    Vetinari provides funding and reprimands
    Criminals form alternate institution of behaviours.

*** Democracy 3 / Africa
    In a Network:
    People / Groups,
    Events
    Policies
    Statistics

    modifiers -> groups -> voting/popularity
    triggers/states -> events -> modifiers
    policies -> modifiers / states
    modifiers -> statistics -> modifiers
    modifiers -> state -> modifiers

    Elements to check:
    There are no islands, all connected. connected components,
    islands, hubs.
    Average, min, max connections, weights.
    Numbers of events/policies/stats/state/groups
    variability of modifiers per node / states
    balance : any nodes purely positive /negative
    cycles?
